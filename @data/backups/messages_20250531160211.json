To address this, we’re enhancing our detection logic to go beyond just the visible file extension. After this rollout, even if a file’s extension is altered, Exchange will evaluate the actual content of the file to determine its true type. This ensures that policies based on file type (such as <i>File extension is…</i>) will remain effective and secure, even when attachments are renamed or disguised.\n\nThis improvement provides you with a more robust and reliable way to enforce compliance and security rules around file sharing.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=493291\" target=\"_blank\">493291</a>.</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-July 2025 and expect to complete by late August 2025.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late August 2025 and expect to complete by late September 2025.\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC, GCC High): We will begin rolling out late August 2025 and expect to complete by mid-October 2025.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>After this rollout, you can configure rules in the Purview portal based on the true file type using the <i>File Extension is</i> predicate in Data Loss Prevention for Exchange Online, and then you will start to see seeing the relevant details for rule matches in all the experiences, such as <i>Alerts </i>and <i>Activity explorer</i>.\n</p><p>To set up this feature for Exchange, go to <i>Data Loss Prevention &gt; Policy Settings &gt; Create rule </i>and use the<i> File extension is</i> condition:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/f72b28e6-0a73-4b61-abd8-238172b0939c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\">\n</p><p>How the configured rule appears in other Purview experiences.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/what-s-new-in-microsoft-teams-rooms-and-devices-at-enterprise/ba-p/3770137\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: 400; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Earlier this year, the new Microsoft device ecosystem platform built on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) was announced</a> delivering state-of-the art security, reliability, and manageability with Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Teams Android devices will be migrating to this platform. The first step in the migration is a firmware update to Microsoft Teams Android devices in 2024. The firmware update will move devices from Android device administrator to Android AOSP management.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>A Preview program for select Microsoft Teams Android devices is targeted for Q2 of calendar year 2024. General release of the firmware update with the Android AOSP management stack will happen starting in Q4 of calendar year 2024 throughout Q1 of calendar year 2025 for all eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices. Auto updates will commence starting May 15th into Q3 calendar year 2025.</p><p>Eligible Microsoft Teams Android devices will initially receive a manual firmware update in Teams Admin Center so IT admins can manually verify the migration on their own schedule on select devices of their choosing.</p><p>Eventually, the firmware update for migration will be scheduled as an automatic firmware update in Teams Admin Center. This automatic firmware update can be deferred for up to 60 days from first availability based upon the admin configured stages in Teams Admin Center.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>The firmware upgrade, including the support for Intune management of Android (AOSP) devices must be accepted. It can be deferred for up to 60 days after it is first available. This can be done in the same way as other firmware upgrades in Teams Admin Center.&nbsp;</p><p>Devices will continue to remain signed in after the firmware upgrade.\n</p><p>Certain legacy devices will not receive the firmware upgrade for Android (AOSP) management in Intune. These devices will continue using Device Administrator.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>Policies will not be migrated automatically between Android device administrator and Android (AOSP) platforms. IT admins will need to create the appropriate new policies under the Intune Android (AOSP) platform to support their Microsoft Teams Android Devices. \n</p><p>This will need to be done before taking the firmware update for a successful migration. \n</p><p>More details on enabling support and creating enrollment profiles and policies for Intune AOSP can be found here: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamssupport/moving-teams-android-devices-to-aosp-device-management/4140893\" target=\"_blank\">Moving Teams Android Devices to AOSP Device Management | Microsoft Community Hub</a></p>\n\n \n<table><tbody>\n\n<tr><th>OEM</th>\n<th>Device Type</th>\n<th>Models</th>\n<th>Targeted Release</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>AudioCodes</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>C470HD</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td><td>Phones</td>\n<td>C430HD\n<br>C435HD\n<br>C455HD<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr><td>AudioCodes&nbsp;</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RXV81<br>RXV200<br>RXPad<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Audiocodes</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>RX Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TSS-770<br>TSS-1070<br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Creston</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Crestron AIO Video Bar 70 \n<br>Crestron Touch Panel TS-1070<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Cisco Room Bar\n<br>Cisco Room Bar Pro \n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQ \n<br>Cisco Room Kit Pro\n<br>Cisco Desk Pro\n<br>Cisco Room Kit EQX \n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 55\n<br>Cisco Board Pro 75\n<br>Cisco Board Pro G2 55 \n<br>Cisco Navigator<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Cisco</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Cisco Navigator Panel</td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>DTEN</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>DTEN D7X 75\"\n<br>DTEN D7X 55\" \n<br>DTEN Bar\n<br>DTEN Mate TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Jabra</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Jabra Panacast 50 VBS\n<br>Jabra Panacast 50 TC<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>RallyBar [VR0019]\n<br>RallyBar mini [VR0020]\n<br>TAP IP [VR0029]\n<br>TAP\n<br>RoomMate [VR0030]\n<br>Logi Rallybar Huddle (VR0034]<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Logitech</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Tap Scheduler  [VR0028]\n<br>DockFlex [VR0035]<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Neat Pad [NF19A1]\n<br>Neat Bar [NF19B1] \n<br>Neat Board [NF19C1]\n<br>Neat Bar Pro [NF21D1]\n<br>Neat Bar Gen2 [NF22E1]\n<br>Neat Board 50 [NF22H1]\n<br>Neat Board Pro 65  [NF23K1]<br></td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Neat Pad [NF19A1]</td>\n<td>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Neat</td>\n<td>Displays</td><td>Neat Frame [NF21F1]</td>\n<td>TBD</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Phones</td>\n<td>CCX350 \n<br>CCX400\n<br>CCX500\n<br>CCX505\n<br>CCX600\n<br>TrioC60<br></td>\n<td>March 25</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Poly Studio X30\n<br>Poly Studio X50\n<br>Poly Studio X52\n<br>Poly Studio X70\n<br>Poly Studio X72\n<br>Poly Studio G7500\n<br>Poly Studio G62\n<br>Poly TC8\n<br>Poly TC10<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Poly</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>TC10 - Panel</td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  [MP5X]</td>\n<td>MP54\n<br>MP56\n<br>MP58\n<br>CP965<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Phones  [MP5X E2]</td>\n<td>MP52E2\n<br>MP54E2\n<br>MP56E2 \n<br>MP58E2<br></td>\n<td>March 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A10\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A20\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A30\n<br>Yealink MeetingBar A40\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 65\"\n<br>Yealink MeetingBoard 86\"\n<br>Yealink Deskvision A24\n<br>Yealink CTP18 \n<br>Yealink CTP25<br></td>\n<td>Available</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Rooms</td>\n<td>Yealink MeetingBar A40</td>\n<td><br>March 2025</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel\n<br>RoomPanel Plus<br></td>\n<td><br>Available</td>\n\n</tr><tr>\n<td>Yealink</td>\n<td>Panels</td>\n<td>Room Panel E2\n<br>RoomPanel Plus E2<br></td>\n<td><br>April 2025</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n</tbody></table>",

No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.

However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.\n</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. \n</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 11, 2024: We have updated the content to reflect the change to Viva Engage. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Non-Native and Hybrid Microsoft Viva Engage (formerly Yammer) Networks will be upgraded to Native Mode to allow users, groups, and content to be compatible with and mapped to their counterparts in Azure Active Directory and Microsoft 365. Native Mode also provides other benefits, such as the ability to host Live Events in every Viva Engage community and simplify file administration through SharePoint. Most critically, Native Mode supports eDiscovery through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, allowing your organization to collaborate safely and securely within your Viva Engage network. 90% of Viva Engage networks are in Native Mode today, including our top 10 largest networks.<br></p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>We will begin migrating networks on December 01, 2022, and continue the upgrades through late December 2024 (previously January). The process will begin with smaller networks. If you prefer to control the timing of your upgrade, you may initiate the process on your own at any time by visiting the Microsoft 365 Native Mode page within the Network Admin pages of Viva Engage.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>You will lose access to the following features:\n</p><ul><li>Network-level guests \n</li><li>Email blocked lists\n</li><li>Secret groups\n</li></ul><p>If your organization has active guest users, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/get-started-with-yammer/azure-ad-b2b-guests-yammer\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Active Directory B2B guest functionality</a> can be used for guests who reside in the same geography as the Viva Engage network (US guests for US networks; EU guests for EU networks). Guests will need to be reinvited to your network.\n</p><p>If your organization currently uses an email blocked list to manage access to your Viva Engage network, you can continue to manage access from the Azure Active Directory Portal. Learn more by visiting <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-viva-engage-users/add-block-or-remove-users\" target=\"_blank\">Add, block, or remove a Viva Engage user</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/manage-engage-licenses-microsoft-365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Viva Engage Core user licenses in Microsoft 365</a>.\n</p><p>These feature equivalents are only available to networks in Native Mode. There is no feature equivalent to secret groups in Microsoft 365; all groups must be public or private.\n</p><p>As part of the migration process, the Viva Engage administrator account will be added to all groups in the network, and files may be renamed.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/native-mode-step-by-step-guide\" target=\"_blank\">step-by-step guide to Native Mode migration</a> available. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is critical that you back up your network’s data and communicate the migration to your users prior to running the Alignment Tool mentioned in the guide, as some data may be deleted during the process.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your migration:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. You can run an alignment report that will identify gaps in your current network alignment with Native Mode. It is strongly recommended that you back up your data and communicate the migration to your users prior to your scheduled migration start date. If your alignment report reveals any blockers to migration, you can log an exception with support.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule your migration around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Please click Additional Information to learn more.</p><p><br></p>",

This integration allows developers to upload complex, organization-specific NLU models that ensure the caller's intent is interpreted accurately, reflecting the unique jargon and vocabulary of the business.<br><br> \n\nThe solution enables developers to design a tailored ontology for their domain, defining intents, entities, and the relationships between them by adding annotated data. They can then build training sets with annotated samples based on this ontology and use them to train and test their language models.<br><br> \n\nImporting large volumes of training data is streamlined to minimize training time, accelerating the development process. Custom NLU support is included at no additional cost for customers with a Dynamics 365 license.<br><br> \n\nOnce your Copilot agent is linked to Dynamics 365 Contact Center, you can select Microsoft Custom NLU from the Language Understanding tab under Settings.

This update does not “sync” personal files with corporate accounts or vice versa. It simply allows access to separate OneDrive accounts on the same device without merging content – similar to checking both work and personal emails on one device without combining inboxes. Administrators who have already restricted personal accounts on corporate devices can continue to manage this as before.\n</p><p>Importantly, this prompt does not combine or transfer files between personal and corporate accounts. Users must take deliberate action to move or save files between accounts, and Microsoft blocks the move of known folders to personal OneDrive accounts from domain joined devices by default. Additionally, data protection features such as sensitivity labels and data loss prevention (DLP) policies continue to apply.\n</p><p>Devices in regions where the Digital Markets Act is applicable will not see this prompt.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare]</p><p>If you don’t want the message prompting users to sign into the OneDrive app with a personal account, you can use policies to disable the prompt.\n</p><p>Organizations that have already disabled personal OneDrive accounts on corporate devices with the <a href=\"https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsharepoint%2Fuse-group-policy%23prevent-users-from-syncing-personal-onedrive-accounts&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cv-rocioclark%40microsoft.com%7C5c756e4f954942746ba408dd9898be59%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638834503998549540%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=R%2FruaKTQf4uklhlXfqD3u81yJXd0%2BKu7fvn20WY%2FGdE%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">DisablePersonalSync</a> policy will not see this prompt.

The system can perform this task for an app after a device reboot and periodically as system conditions allow.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC, GCC High, DoD): We will begin rolling out late May 2025 (previously mid-May) and expect to complete by late July 2025 (previously late May).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>New tasks will be publicly visible in the Windows Task Scheduler.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Task Names: Office Startup Boost and Office Startup Boost Logon.</li><li>Task Description: This task ensures that Office applications can take advantage of preloading performance enhancements.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Initial roll-out will be on Microsoft Word. We have no announcements to make at this time regarding support for additional applications.</p><p>Startup Boost is only available when your PC has enough resources to run without impacting system performance. This includes having at least 8 GB of available RAM, and at least 5 GB of available disk space. When Startup Boost is active, the scheduled task will not run immediately at login to avoid slowing down your PC — it will wait 10 minutes to ensure the system is in a steady idle state. Additionally, Startup Boost will be disabled when Energy Saver mode is active. Startup Boost only runs if you have launched Word recently, and if you have not launched Word recently it will automatically disable itself.</p><p>Startup Boost is an optional performance feature. It is safe to disable. When disabled, Microsoft Office applications will be fully functional but may take longer to load. Customers can disable Startup Boost entirely by preventing the process from starting. To disable the feature, use the in-app setting, e.g., <i>Word &gt; Options &gt; General &gt; Startup Boost (under Start up Options)</i>.</p><p>Scheduled task entry in Task Scheduler:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/da011aba-1d94-42a5-8bb7-507075d26620\" style=\"width: 450px;\"></p><p><br></p><p>End-user UI to enable/disable Startup Boost in Word:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/e038abb2-c032-48ed-a891-5bfcba1bad8e\" style=\"width: 450px;\"><br></p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically with no admin action required.&nbsp;</p><p>You can disable this Startup Boost task like any other scheduled task.

The Facilitator app will be on by default unless all apps are blocked by your organization. For use in meetings, Facilitator will be off by default, and licensed users will have the option to enable.

As a part of the security promise, you can discover, protect, and govern AI interactions with Facilitator through Microsoft Purview. Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI helps IT and security teams proactively discover and manage data risks. Use DSPM for AI in conjunction with other Microsoft Purview capabilities such as Audit, eDiscovery, and Data Lifecycle Management to ensure data security and compliance for your organization.

Review your current configuration to determine the impact for your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p><p><b>Known Limitations\n</b></p><p>Sensitivity labels applied to the meeting will not automatically be applied to the meeting notes file. For example, if an organizer marks a meeting as highly confidential and turns on AI-generated notes, those notes will not be marked as highly confidential. The suggested workaround is to not use Facilitator in meetings where sensitive information will be discussed. This limitation will be documented in admin and end user documentation at release. Microsoft is actively working on meeting sensitivity label inheritance to notes and will provide more updates as they are available.\n</p><p>Learn more \n</p><ul><li>If you're using Microsoft 365 Copilot in your organization (with your work or school account): <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-privacy\" target=\"_blank\">Data, Privacy, and Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li>Admin documentation: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/facilitator-teams\" target=\"_blank\">Set up Facilitator in Microsoft Teams for collaborative AI notes - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn (will be updated before rollout)</a></li><li>User documentation (meetings): <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/automate-notetaking-in-microsoft-teams-meetings-37657f91-39b5-40eb-9421-45141e3ce9f6\" target=\"_blank\">Automate notetaking in Microsoft Teams meetings - Microsoft Support (will be updated before rollout)</a></li></ul><p></p>",

Please refer to this new post going forward:</p><p>Coming soon: Eligible users will be prompted in the Message Bar below the toolbar in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows desktops to enroll in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/redirect-known-folders\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive Known Folder Move (KFM).</a> Users will be able to select the folders to back up in Microsoft OneDrive.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-April 2025 and expect to complete by late April 2025. \n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously early May) and expect to complete by mid-June 2025.</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>If your organization still has users who are not enrolled in KFM, the message \"BACK UP THIS DOCUMENT: Share and work with others in this and other files using OneDrive\" will encourage them to do it while using familiar desktop apps. After users select the Open OneDrive button, they can select the folders they want to back up in OneDrive:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/ccp/en-us/ca81daa5-b315-416d-966e-bed4ff8723ea\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user message\">\n</p><p>When users are enrolled in KFM, the files in their enrolled folder benefit from the advantages of cloud files:\n</p><ul><li>Increased security and compliance: Enterprises can increase security and compliance, because all cloud files are subject to default classification, labeling, and protection (CLP) policies and auto-labeling. \n</li><li>Copilot support: Files are Copilot-enabled, making it simple and intuitive to access and leverage Copilot. (A Microsoft 365 Copilot license or a Microsoft 365 license is required to use Copilot.)</li><li>Easy collaboration: Cloud files enable sharing, commenting, and easy collaboration, with AutoSave ensuring changes are frequently and consistently saved. \n</li><li>Access from anywhere: Cloud files can be accessed from Windows, Mac, the web, iOS, and Android with synchronized changes. \n</li><li>Backup: Protection from data loss due to device failure. \n</li><li>Access to cloud-specific features like AutoSave and Version History</li></ul><p>After enrolling, users can access their files in the known folders in File Explorer or OneDrive. \n</p><p>No action required.

Effective May 19, 2025, when a user connects to an open Wi-Fi network on a mobile device, an alert will no longer be generated on the security portal. Instead, this activity will be recorded as an event and viewable under the device timeline. Similarly, detecting a suspicious certificate during download and installation will also be recorded as an event rather than generating an alert. This change ensures administrators still have visibility without generating alerts there by reducing fatigue. \n</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>This change will take effect in a phased rollout starting late May 2025 (previously May 19).\n</p><p>[How this affects your organization:]</p><p>This update addresses customer feedback about alert fatigue, especially in environments with high mobile device usage. By logging events like open Wi-Fi connections and suspicious certificate detections in the device timeline rather than triggering alerts, we help reduce noise and streamline operations. This change benefits SOC analysts and administrators by preserving visibility into potential risky events while allowing them to focus on high-priority incidents, improving overall triage efficiency.\n</p><p>[How the experience looks after the change:]</p><p>Current security and privacy settings will remain unchanged.

With this setting on, data sent to Azure Maps can be processed in a region where the service is available, which might be outside your tenant's geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance.</td><td>Off by default, except for existing tenants that have turned on Azure Maps.</td></tr><tr><td>Data sent to Azure Maps can be processed by Microsoft Online Services Subprocessors.</td>\n<td>Some Azure Maps visual services, including the selection tool, may require mapping capabilities provided in part by Microsoft Online Services subprocessors.

The default availability of Azure Maps is changing as part of this update, so more users may have access to the visual by default in your tenant. If you are in a region where Azure Map services are not available and you weren't already using Azure Maps in your tenant, you will need to enable the tenant setting that allows processing data sent to Azure Maps outside your tenant's region for the map visual to work. \n</p><p>The tenant switch controlling the availability of the Azure Map visual will be on by default. The settings controlling if data sent to Azure Maps can be processed outside of your tenant's region and can be sent to subprocessors will both be on for tenants already using Azure Maps and will be off by default for everyone else. \n</p><p>To continue using the Azure Maps visual, you’ll need to be on at least the April 2025 version of Power BI Desktop for Windows.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>In mid-January, Microsoft Copilot will become available to users with an Entra account in Microsoft Teams and Outlook. If pinned, Entra users will be able to access the Microsoft Copilot app directly from the left rail in Outlook and Teams. On Teams Mobile, the pinned app will show up in the top header. Microsoft Copilot will also become available in the Store for users to add on their own, managed by the same admin settings used for app availability today. Outlook Mobile will have Copilot show up in the tab bar starting in February.</p><p>Note: During the rollout, the Microsoft Copilot app will temporarily be available for Semi-Annual Channel users of classic Outlook for Windows. These clients will respect admin and user preferences, but we typically do not show Copilot features in Semi-Annual Channel of classic Outlook for Windows. After customers update to Version 2408 or newer, the Microsoft Copilot app will once again be hidden for Semi-Annual Channel users.</p><p>In addition, users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will have Copilot automatically pinned in the left rail in Teams, along with the Copilot chat that is automatically pinned in the Teams Chat pane for them today.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=420330\" target=\"_blank\">420330</a>\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The Microsoft 365 Copilot app will be pinned by default in the Teams left rail staring late January 2025 (previously mid-January)  and is expected to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January).</p><p> </p><ul><li>On Teams Mobile, the pinned app will show up in the top header.&nbsp;</li><li>Outlook Mobile will have Copilot show up in the tab bar starting in mid-February 2025.</li></ul><p>General Availability (Worldwide): The Microsoft Copilot app will be available to install and pin in Outlook starting mid-February 2025 (previously late January) and is expected to complete by mid-March 2025 (previously late February).

If pinned, users will be able to access the Microsoft Copilot app in Teams and Outlook.\n</p><p>If your admins or users previously chose to pin Microsoft Copilot across the M365 app, Teams, and Outlook before pinning was released on Teams and Outlook, Microsoft Copilot will be retroactively pinned for them there.</p><p>Microsoft Copilot will also be added to the Store for users to add on their own. For licensed users, Microsoft 365 Copilot has already been installed, and users can open it from the Store.</p><p>Finally, in Teams, users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license will be able to access Copilot in the left rail as a pinned app by default, along with the Teams Chat pane where they can find it today. On Teams Mobile, users can access Copilot in the top header, and on Outlook Mobile in the tab bar.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>Admins can control if Microsoft Copilot is pinned in Teams and Outlook using the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/microsoft-365/pin-copilot\" target=\"_blank\">same Copilot pinning control shared previously to pin Copilot in the Microsoft 365 app.</a> Admins can also pin Microsoft Copilot in Teams by adding Copilot to Pinned apps in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies\" target=\"_blank\">app Setup policies</a> and assigning the policies to unlicensed users in Teams admin center.\n</p><p>With the pinning control, you have the option to pin or not pin Copilot for your users. If you select to not pin Copilot, you also have the option to allow your users to be notified to make this choice. If no action is taken, Copilot will not be pinned but users will be notified to pin it themselves.\n</p><p>Users can unpin Copilot in Outlook. Users can unpin Copilot in Teams if User pinning is enabled in app <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies#pin-apps\" target=\"_blank\">Setup policies.</a>\n</p><p>Currently, you can remove access to Copilot in the Microsoft 365 app and copilot.cloud.microsoft as documented in <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/manage#removing-access-to-microsoft-\" target=\"_blank\">Removing access to Microsoft Copilot</a>.

      "Content": "<p>Updated May 8, 2025: This change is now on hold, with further guidance to be provided by late May 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, we introduced Microsoft Teams apps that are compatible with Microsoft Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App (manifest version v1.13 or higher). Before this rollout, admin changes made in the Integrated apps section of the Microsoft 365 admin center would only affect these Teams apps in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app. Similarly, changes made in the Teams admin center would exclusively affect Teams. Starting in June 2024, we will roll out Unified App Management to streamline the management of these apps across Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App, so they are consistently available across all supported clients.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=393931\" target=\"_blank\">393931</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen in two major phases. Unified App Management can apply only to tenants that have migrated to app centric management in Teams admin center, as communicated in MC688930 <i>(Updated) Teams admin center: App centric management and changes to app permission policies</i> (November 2023).\n</p><ul><li>Phase 1 | General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out late-January 2025 (previously mid-December 2024) is now on hold (previously late March 2025), with further guidance to be provided by late May 2025 (previously late April). This phase applies to tenants with no modified settings in either the Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) or the Teams admin center for organization-wide defaults, app deployment, app availability, or block/unblock. No merge rules apply to these tenants, but after this phase, any app management setting configured in either admin centers will apply to all relevant hosts. \n</li><li>Phase 2: We will update this post with a timeline and more details in May 2025 (previously April 2025).&nbsp; This phase is applicable to tenants with app settings that have differences between Microsoft 365 admin center (Integrated apps) and Teams admin center.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before this rollout, managing Teams apps that work in Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app was fragmented between the <i>Integrated app</i>s page in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app, and the Teams admin center for Teams. This sometimes resulted in different settings for the same app in the two admin centers. With Unified App Management, we will be consolidating app catalog management into a single platform. You will be able to manage apps on the <i>Integrated apps</i> page in the Microsoft 365 admin center or in the Teams admin center, and any changes made in either admin center will synchronize.\n</p><p><i>What you can expect</i>\n</p><ol><li>App catalog enhancements: Apps will start showing hosts where they are available: Teams, Outlook, or the Microsoft 365 app. \n</li><li>Organization-wide settings: App availability default settings will now apply to apps used in Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 app.\n</li><li>App installs: Apps deployed from the Integrated apps page in Microsoft 365 admin center will be preinstalled in all applicable hosts for the app. Unlike app preinstallation in the Teams App setup policy, new app installs will provide access to the preinstalled apps, similar to deploying the app for Outlook and the Microsoft 365 App. [For more details on app deployment, refer to MC795355&nbsp;<i>Microsoft Teams admin center: App centric management for app installation and changes to app setup policies</i> (May 2024)].</li><li>App availability: Managing app availability will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>App block/unblock: Blocking or unblocking apps will apply to all applicable app hosts. \n</li><li>Consolidation of existing app settings: All existing app settings will be unified between Integrated apps (MAC) and Manage apps (TAC) pages. Merge rules can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/manage-apps-across-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage apps that work across Teams, Outlook, and Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>. These changes cannot be rolled back.\n</li><li>Consolidation report: After further review we have decided not to proceed with this change at this time. We apologize for any inconvenience.</li></ol><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>We recommend that you review app and tenant settings in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the Teams admin center. If these are managed by different departments in your organization, we recommend conducting these reviews collaboratively.\n</p><p>We also recommend that you review the merge rules and consider their potential impact on apps in your organization. Make any necessary adjustments to unify them in advance, if the merge rules in this message do not align with your expectations.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation as appropriate.\n</p>",

There is no action taken from these policies to block content, as policies are meant to scope what content is collected and surfaces to administrators.</li><li>Using collection policies to scope signal collection will impact what is surfaced in several Purview solutions, including Insider Risk Management (IRM), Data Security Posture Management (DSPM), eDiscovery, Data Lifecycle Management (DLM), Activity Explorer, and more. Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Overview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release. If you choose to leverage collection policies, admins can now choose which signals to discover in devices.\n</p><p>After you enable collection policies, you may see various updates to the Purview DLP audit experience. These updates may affect your organizations current configuration in the following ways: \n</p><ul><li>Activities to audit on your tenant will be scoped to the selected SITs and user activities \n</li><li>A new Location picker experience will be used to scope users and groups \n</li><li>To use collection policies for endpoints, the DLP <i>Always audit </i>setting will still need to be enabled. However, once created, collection policies for endpoint devices adjust from an open policy to an allowlisting policy that supports inclusion and/or exclusion of specific users, groups, and specified activities to reduce load and address customer requirements. \n</li></ul><p>This feature is available by default for admins to configure.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>There is no immediate impact of this feature release until you create an initial collection policy and <i>Always audit</i> is enabled in DLP (Windows endpoint devices only). To prepare for this upcoming enhancement to the Purview portal, we recommend you:</p><ul><li>Review Microsoft Learn docs on collection policies and required prerequisites: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/collection-policies-solution-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Collection Policies Solution Oerview (preview) | Microsoft Learn</a></li><li>Help inform other Purview admins whose signal collection would be scoped, including the solutions in this message. \n</li></ul><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified dates with no admin action required before the rollout. Review your current configuration to assess the impact on your organization. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.</p>",

If you are currently following this guidance, <b>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain</b>. \n</li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p>\n\n<ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences. You can refer them to <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-is-cloud-microsoft-7ba4c8b9-d062-4444-84a5-fca6c3006d2b\" target=\"_blank\">What is cloud.microsoft? - Microsoft Support</a> for more information. \n</li><li>If your organizational websites, tools, or other materials reference the old URL, those links will be automatically redirected. However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.&nbsp;</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain.&nbsp;</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks. This should require no action if standard <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft network guidance on domains and service endpoints</a> is being followed.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 29, 2025: We have updated the content. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Enforcement began on January 27, 2025. The rollout has slowed to ensure a safe roll-out with sufficient time for admins to adjust. Admins should anticipate that it takes time for all unlicensed accounts to complete the enforcement process. The initial enforcement rollout will be complete by October 29, 2025.\n</p><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed before July 28, 2025\n</b></p><ul><li>September 26, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts transition to read-only mode. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.\n</li><li>October 29, 2025: By this date, all unlicensed accounts are archived. Admins are advised to check after this date. Checking earlier can result in an incomplete status snapshot.</li></ul><p><b>Timeline for accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025</b></p><ul><li>For accounts unlicensed after July 28, 2025, the account will be put into read-only mode on the 60th unlicensed day, and will be archived or moved to the recycle bin on the 93rd unlicensed day.\n</li></ul><p><b>Example:\n</b></p><ul><li>Unlicensed Date: October 1, 2025\n</li><li>Day 60: Nov 30, 2025. The account is placed in read-only mode. </li><li>Day 93: January 2, 2026: The account is archived. If the user is still active in Entra ID but the admin hasn't enabled billing, then this is also the date on which the account will begin the deprovisioning process.</li><li>Admins are encouraged to monitor account statuses based on these timelines to ensure compliance and take any necessary actions.</li></ul><p>[When will this happen:] \n</p><p>&nbsp;General Availability (Worldwide): We began rolling out late January 2025 and expect to complete by late October 2025 (previously late March).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization]\n</p><p>After this storage policy goes into effect in your tenant, any OneDrive user accounts that have been unlicensed for more than 93 days will be archived automatically and will become inaccessible to end users. Admins can view these accounts with admin tools, but the accounts will not be accessible to users until admins take action on them. For example, a OneDrive account that became unlicensed on August 1, 2025 will be inaccessible to users as of October 1, 2025.</p><p>As an admin, you can view a list of unlicensed accounts in your tenant by navigating to SharePoint admin center &gt; <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i>. Some admins will have access to this page as soon as July 26, 2024, but most admins will be able to access the page closer to August 16, 2024.\n</p><ul><li>Set up the Archive billing for unlicensed accounts to be able to access and edit the archived files.\n</li><li>Delete the unlicensed OneDrive account, if it does not have a retention policy applied to it. \n</li><li>Renew the unlicensed account to maintain access.\n</li></ul><p></p><p>The <i>Unlicensed OneDrive accounts</i> page that will be in Microsoft admin center:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f5c65a0-5515-49e1-b876-07e81c69a89a\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin controls\"> \n</p><p>After the unlicensed accounts are automatically archived, you can access the files in these accounts by enabling unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Once enabled, unlicensed account billing applies to all unlicensed OneDrive accounts in your tenant. There is a fee of $0.05/GB/month to store unlicensed accounts in the Microsoft 365 Archive, and a fee of $0.60/GB to reactivate accounts stored in the Microsoft 365 Archive. Account reactivation takes up to 24 hours and provides 30 days of access to the account, and then the account returns to an archived state.\n</p><p>If you take no action for OneDrive accounts that have been unlicensed for longer than 93 days, these accounts will remain inaccessible to end users until you set up an Azure subscription and enable unlicensed account billing in the Microsoft SharePoint admin center. This action will not affect tenants who have not changed the default tenant retention settings.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare]\n</p><p>To prepare for this change, admins can view a list of all the unlicensed OneDrive accounts in their tenant by going to the SharePoint admin center and navigating to <i>Reports &gt; OneDrive accounts</i> (this page will be rolled out to admins between July 26, 2024 and August 16, 2024). This page will provide the number of unlicensed accounts and why the accounts are unlicensed. You may have unlicensed accounts in your tenant for four reasons: \n</p><ol><li>Retention period – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention period setting is keeping the account from being deleted.\n</li><li>Retention policy – Account is no longer licensed but is still active because a retention policy in Purview is keeping the account from being deleted. \n</li><li>Active user with no license – Account is active but is not licensed. This can happen if the license is removed but the user is not removed from Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory).  \n</li><li>Duplicate accounts – Account is a duplicate because a licensed user has multiple OneDrive accounts associated with them. Duplicate accounts (also known as non-primary accounts) may arise if a user has geographic move, if a user leaves and then rejoins an organization, or from other factors. \n</li></ol><p>After you have taken inventory of your unlicensed accounts, we recommend that you take the following action before January 27, 2025. \n</p><ol><li>Delete unlicensed accounts that you no longer wish to retain. \n</li><li>Set up billing for accounts that you wish to retain.\n</li><li>You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation.\n</li></ol><p>*<b>At this time, these changes do not apply to customers in Education tenants. An Education tenant is any tenant with more than 50% education licenses. Any tenant with fewer than 50% education licenses is considered commercial.&nbsp;</b>However, for any education tenant, unlicensed OneDrive accounts consume pooled storage and can pose security and compliance risks. IT admins can view the unlicensed accounts on the <i>OneDrive accounts</i> page to identify unlicensed accounts and take action.</p><p><i>Learn more</i>\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/SharePoint/unlicensed-onedrive-accounts\" target=\"_blank\">Manage unlicensed OneDrive user accounts - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/retention-and-deletion\" target=\"_blank\">OneDrive retention and deletion - SharePoint in Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/delete-a-user?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">Delete a user from your organization - Microsoft 365 admin | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated April 21, 2025: We have updated the timelines below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>To reduce the risk of misuse and abuse of Exchange Online resources and ensure service availability for all users, we’ll soon introduce new tenant-level outbound email limits, known as the Tenant External Recipient Rate Limit or TERRL. The TERRL restricts the number of external recipients a tenant can send email to per day. If the limit is exceeded further messages sent to external recipients from the tenant will be blocked until the volume for the last 24 hours drops below the quota. A tenant’s TERRL quota is calculated based on the number of email licenses a tenant has purchased. Here is the formula used to calculate a tenant’s quota:\n</p><p>500 * (Purchased Email Licenses^0.7) + 9500\n</p><p>To help admins plan and track their outbound email volume, you’ll find a new report in the Exchange admin center: <i>EAC &gt; Reports &gt; Mail flow &gt; Tenant Outbound External Recipients Rate</i>. This report shows the current volume of external recipients, your tenant’s daily quota, how much of the quota is used, and the number of recipients that were blocked if the limit was exceeded. The report will also show if enforcement for the limit is enabled or disabled. For example, for tenants who have more than 500 email licenses it will show “Disabled” until May 1st, the day we’ll start to enable enforcement for tenants who have more than 500 licenses.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>This change will roll out in progressive stages over the month of March as per the following rollout schedule:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Phase</td><td>Enable enforcement for tenant group</td><td>Rollout start date</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Tenants with &lt;= 25 email licenses</td><td>April 3, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>+ additional tenants with &lt;= 200 licenses</td><td>April 18, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>+ additional tenants with &lt;= 500 licenses</td><td>April 28, 2025</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>+ all remaining tenants</td><td>May 9, 2025</td></tr></tbody></table><p>[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p>If your tenant exceeds its daily outbound sending limit further messages sent to external recipients will be blocked and senders will receive one of the following bounce messages (also known as Non-Delivery Receipts or NDRs):\n</p><ul><li>Trial tenants: 550 5.7.232 - Your message can't be sent because your trial tenant has exceeded its daily limit for sending email to external recipients (tenant external recipient rate limit)\n</li><li>Non-trial tenants: 550 5.7.233 - Your message can't be sent because your tenant exceeded its daily limit for sending email to external recipients (tenant external recipient rate limit)\n</li></ul><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]</p><p>Check the report in the EAC to see your tenant’s quota and current daily outbound email volume and whether or not any messages will be blocked once the TERRL is enabled for your tenant. If your current outbound email volume is well below the quota, you don’t have to do anything. If your outbound email volume is near or exceeding your quota, consider using <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services email</a> for high-volume email to external recipients instead. ACS email which offers significant advantages and features for high-volume email, especially for external recipients. Messages sent using ACS email are not counted against your Tenant External Recipient Rate Limit quota.\n</p><p>For more information about the Tenant External Recipient Rate feature and report please see this blog post:\n</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/introducing-exchange-online-tenant-outbound-email-limits/4372797\" target=\"_blank\">Introducing Exchange Online Tenant Outbound Email Limits</a></li></ul>",

We have made progress on closing several parity gaps with more changes in development to be released in the coming quarters. Please refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't already, start the process of working with your application development organization and your application vendors to migrate active EWS applications on your tenant to the Graph API.&nbsp;</p><p>\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>October 1, 2026</p><p>[How this affects your organization:]</p><p>While the EWS components of the service will continue to receive security updates and certain non-security updates, product design and features will remain unchanged. This change also applies to the EWS SDKs for Java and .NET, as well.\n</p><p>Despite this announcement, EWS is still available and supported for use in production environments. But we strongly suggest migrating to Microsoft Graph to access Exchange Online data and gain access to the latest features and functionality.\n</p><p>Today’s update and the retirement of EWS apply only to Microsoft 365 and Exchange Online (all environments); there are no changes to EWS in Exchange Server. Further, the changes in Exchange Online do not affect Outlook for Windows or Mac, Teams, or any other Microsoft product.</p><p>In our original blog post, we said this change would affect only third-party (non-Microsoft) applications.<b> We have expanded our effort and are now also removing EWS dependencies from Microsoft apps and services, and we’re going to complete that work well before October 2026</b>. We intend to do this as quickly as possible without affecting the quality of service or product.&nbsp;</p><p>There may be applications running on your tenant created by your organization or 3rd parties that use EWS. <b>We recommend <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/ews-usage?view=o365-worldwide\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing your application portfolio</a> now </b>to get an understanding of which apps need to be updated by your organization and which applications require updates from vendors.</p><p>It is important to get started with this effort as soon as possible as the Graph API patterns are quite different from EWS. Equivalent Graph API operations may exhibit subtle differences that affect your use cases and application designs in unanticipated ways.</p><p>Migrating Applications to Microsoft Graph&nbsp;</p><p>We know there are several feature gaps between EWS and Microsoft Graph, and though the list below is not exhaustive, these are the gaps most frequently reported to us by developers:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to Archive Mailboxes – We are working on delivering access to archive mailboxes via Microsoft Graph and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Folder Associated Information / User Configuration – We are working on these features and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.\n</li><li>Exchange Online Management – We are investigating solutions for this and will provide an updated timeline in the coming months.</li><li>Access to Public Folders – After evaluating the usage of public folders, we have decided to restrict programmatic access to public folders to supported Outlook clients only, and for bulk import/export purposes. We will not provide APIs for programmatically creating, reading, updating and deleting public folders after October 2026 (also see <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/security-related-updates-in-exchange-online/4303525\" target=\"_blank\">Security Related Updates in Exchange Online</a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><p>We know there are other gaps not listed above, and we continue to work on closing them, but it’s possible some functionality will not make it to Microsoft Graph. We encourage you to refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online</a> for up-to-date guidance and roadmap information.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Next Steps\n</b></p><p>The retirement of these APIs follows our <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a>. We understand changes like this may cause some inconvenience, but we are confident it will ensure more secure, reliable, and performant experiences.\n</p><p>We will publish regular communications as we progress towards this deadline to aid affected tenants in identifying EWS usage. We encourage all customers to monitor Message Center and the Exchange Blog and <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/deprecation-of-ews-exchange-online\" target=\"_blank\">Deprecation of Exchange Web Services in Exchange Online </a>for related content.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance for updating and opening your apps to a wider range of useful and intelligent features on Microsoft Graph. We are extremely excited about the growing opportunities that Microsoft Graph offers to developers, and we remain fully committed to our journey to empower developers to access Microsoft 365 data with the most modern features and tools.</p>",

See below for details.</p><p style=\"\">The migration to app-centric management using the Migration Wizard (Phase 2) started rolling out in late November 2024 and completed rolling out in mid-December 2024. Administrators are now able to start the migration themselves using the wizard. The automatic migration for customers with only a global permission policy (Phase 1) will complete by end-March 2025 and those with multiple permission policies (Phase 3) will begin in April 2025</p><p style=\"\">Detailed documentation for the migration process is available at <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/app-centric-management\" target=\"_blank\">App centric management to manage user access to Teams apps - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a>.</p><p style=\"\">App centric management introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant can install Teams apps. First, admins can set a default value for new apps that are published to the Teams app store. Second, admins can manage apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization. This feature replaces the existing app permission policies and provides admins with the ability to manage access to the app individually. The app permission policies for existing customers are migrated to maintain existing app availability in the tenant.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"\">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters%3D&amp;searchterms=151829\" target=\"_blank\">151829&nbsp;</a> </p><p style=\"\">[When this will happen:]</p><p style=\"\">This feature will gradually roll out across three major phases.</p><p style=\"\">Phase 1 (Complete):  Auto-migration for only single policy customers - This is applicable for customer with only a global permission policy.

There will be no further exceptions granted.</p><p style=\"\">Phase 3: Auto-migration for all customers – This is for customers who have not completed self-migration in Phase 2. This has started in mid-April and will complete by mid-May 2025 for customers with custom permission policies, but no users assigned to them. All other customers will be auto-migrated starting in mid-May until end of June 2025 (previously starting April 2025).&nbsp; Auto-migration will maintain the same access defined in app permission policies whenever there is no conflict between a user’s assigned policies. If a user’s policies conflict by allowing and blocking the same app for them, we will auto-migrate their app as allowed. After auto-migration, there will be a security group created for each set of users assigned to each app permission policy. These groups will be assigned to each app they are allowed in their respective policy, maintaining their app access. Groups Administrators can manage these groups like any others to customize the app centric management assignments, such as adding and removing users, or removing the group and replacing it with another.</p><p style=\"\">[How this will affect your organization:]</p><p style=\"\">Starting with this release, you can:</p><p style=\"\">1.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>As we continue to enhance OneNote with a unified and modern experience, we want to remind you that OneNote for Windows 10 will reach end of support on October 14, 2025. To avoid disruptions, we strongly urge you to transition to OneNote on Windows (OneNote for Microsoft 365) and recommend uninstalling OneNote for Windows 10 as part of this process to avoid user confusion. This migration will ensure your team stay up to date with the latest features, security updates, and performance improvements.</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>OneNote for Windows 10 will reach end of support on October 14, 2025.</p><p>How this affects your organization:]</p><ul><li><b>Enhanced Security &amp; Compliance</b>: OneNote for Windows 10 will not receive new security features, such as Sensitivity Labeling, because it does not support Microsoft Information Protection (MIP). As a result, users still using OneNote for Windows 10 will be unable to access labeled content once labeling is enabled in OneNote.\n</li><li><b>Access to New Features &amp; AI-Powered Copilot</b>: OneNote on Windows (Microsoft 365) is our primary OneNote experience, with ongoing investments in AI-powered tools like Copilot to boost productivity. OneNote on Windows 10 no longer receives any new functionality.\n</li><li><b>Improved Performance &amp; Support</b>: OneNote for Windows 10 no longer receives updates or bug fixes, which may impact performance over time.\n</li><li><b>Enhanced Sync &amp; Collaboration</b>: OneNote for Microsoft 365 is continually improving sync and reliability. Starting in June 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 may experience changes to their sync behavior due to updates in security and services, which may require reopening notebooks to resume syncing. Additionally, the sync experience on OneNote for Windows 10 may be slower compared to OneNote on Windows.\n</li><li><b>A Smooth Transition Experience</b>: Starting in July 2025, users of OneNote for Windows 10 will receive in-app banner notifications guiding them to switch to OneNote for Microsoft 365 ensuring a smooth transition and continuity in their workflow.</li></ul><p>[What you can do to prepare:]</p><p>To help your users transition smoothly, we recommend starting the migration process now. Our migration guide and script are available to support you every step of the way.\n</p><p>Migration guide: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/onenote-for-windows-10-migration-guide\" target=\"_blank\">OneNote for Windows 10 migration guidance - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>\n</p><p>For assistance, contact:\n</p><ul><li><b>Microsoft Support\n</b></li><li><b>OneNote In-app Support</b> via Help &gt; Support in OneNote on Windows.</li></ul><p>We appreciate your partnership in making this transition as smooth as possible for your organization.

      "Content": "<p>Coming soon: You will be able to extend Microsoft Purview to the network layer by integrating Purview with your preferred Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) solution. Through this integration, admins can intercept and inspect traffic flowing through the network layer to identify the presence of sensitive data. This enables admins to detect sensitive data shared with untrusted cloud applications through browsers, applications, APIs, add-ins, and more, including common generative AI, cloud storage, and content sharing services. The signals from inline discovery for the network further enrich Purview solutions including Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and Insider Risk Management (IRM), helping admins better understand how to reduce data exfiltration risks to locations outside of their organization.

These policies are designed to discover relevant signals from data in transit without executing any enforcement actions on that data.  \n</p><p>After integrating with one of our already-integrated Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) / Security Service Edge (SSE) partners, data security admins will be able to centrally create and manage policies for the network from the Purview portal. \n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p> After rollout, the new policies and features will be available by default for you to enable and configure.

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>Coming soon for Microsoft Purview: We are announcing the public preview of the integration of Adaptive protection with Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) to help you find the right balance to protect against data sabotage while enabling productivity. This new integration leverages DLM features to provide an additional control for Adaptive protection that automatically preserves items deleted by a user with an elevated risk level, so items can be restored if needed.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=392839\" target=\"_blank\">392839</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Public preview: We will begin rolling out in late June 2024 (previously early May) and expect to complete by late July 2024 (previously mid-July).\n</p><p>General Availability:&nbsp; We will begin rolling out in late September 2025 (previously late May) and expect to complete by mid-October 2025 (previously mid-June).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>After the rollout, and after you enable Adaptive protection for your tenant, the retention label and auto-apply policy for data lifecycle management will be automatically created for you. This policy will automatically include elevated risk users identified by Microsoft Purview | Insider Risk Management solution. If these users delete content from Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft OneDrive, or Microsoft Exchange, a retention label is automatically applied to that content to retain it for 120 days. Retention labels are automatically applied to unlabeled content deleted by these users. When these users are no longer at the elevated risk level, they are automatically removed from the DLM policy, and the system will no longer keep a copy of content they delete. Any content copies previously retained when the user had an elevated risk level will be kept for the 120 days as specified by the retention label.\n</p><p>Unlike other retention labeling scenarios, users do not see the retention label, and you do not need to create or manage the retention label or policy. At this time, you can't change the retention period or assign different policies based on the different risk levels, or for different locations. The single retention label and auto-labeling policy for your tenant is not visible in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>Learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/retention#dynamically-mitigate-the-risk-of-accidental-or-malicious-deletes\" target=\"_blank\">Learn about retention policies &amp; labels to retain or delete | Microsoft Learn</a>\n</p><p>If you're using Adaptive protection and want to automatically retain content deleted by elevated risk users, follow these steps to turn on this new integration.\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to the <a href=\"https://compliance.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Purview compliance portal</a>.\n</li><li>Navigate to <i>Data lifecycle management &gt; Microsoft 365 &gt; Adaptive protection settings</i> in the top right corner.\n</li><li>Turn the setting ON and select <i>Save</i>.\n</li></ol><p>\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/fe6a20ed-77ce-44ce-b862-bc7f4b78b93e\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/521b359c-13a9-41ef-ad96-215789a32eb3\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"admin settings\">\n</p><p>If you’re not using Adaptive protection already, turn on Adaptive protection and the new feature will be enabled along with Adaptive protection.\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Between July 1st and August 1st, 2025, we will gradually switch provisioning of all A records for new Accepted Domains into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.</p><p>We are doing this to reduce the friction of adopting DNSSEC in the long run. DNSSEC is a set of extensions to DNS that provides cryptographic verification of DNS records, preventing DNS spoofing and adversary-in-the-middle attacks to DNS.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>After August 1st 2025, all A records for new Accepted Domains will be provisioned into the new subdomains under mx.microsoft.\n</p><p>DNS resolution will safely fallback to “plain” DNS if a domain is not DNSSEC enabled. If an Accepted Domain you add to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1st is not secured with DNSSEC at the domain level (ex. contoso.com), then DNS resolution will work as usual. If an Accepted Domain you add to the EAC after July 1st is secured with DNSSEC, then DNSSEC will extend to the mx.microsoft DNS record automatically and you will get the benefits of DNSSEC without having to take any further action. Any issues with DNSSEC can be addressed by disabling DNSSEC for the Accepted Domain (ex. contoso.com) via your DNS provider.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>If you have any automation in place, for example in workflows for Domain Setup, for MX record creation that expects A records for newly provisioned Accepted Domains to be provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com, this automation needs to be updated by July 1st to use List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API (<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/domain-list-serviceconfigurationrecords?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\" target=\"_blank\">List serviceConfigurationRecords</a>). Use List serviceConfigurationRecords to retrieve the mailExchange value for your MX record. After July 1st, List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API will be the only source of truth for your Accepted Domains’ MX record value. You will not be able to rely on the Accepted Domain’s A record being provisioned in mail.protection.outlook.com after July 1st.\n</p><p>If you are using automation that expects the record to end with mail.protection.outlook.com, when you add a new Accepted Domain to the Exchange Admin Center after July 1st, mail flow may not work upon initial configuration and you will have to update your MX record to match what the Exchange Admin Center says for the domain or use the mailExchange value returned by List serviceConfigurationRecords Graph API.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback. \n</p><p><br></p>",

If a user opens a Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint file and there is a conflict that requires user input to resolve, the user will be given the option to choose the file variation to keep. If the conflict cannot be resolved, a banner will display to either <i>Save a Copy</i> of the file or <i>Discard Changes</i> if the user doesn't care about the changes that were made.</p><p>User notification to choose the file variation to keep in PowerPoint:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/d89770ef-cd05-4488-8fb2-16b07819ff7f\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user notification\">\n</p><p>User notification to <i>Save a Copy </i>or <i>Discard Changes</i> in PowerPoint:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/f96f50cb-5046-4820-8d83-afba0508c23c\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user notification\">\n</p><p>User notification to <i>Save a Copy</i> or <i>Discard Changes i</i>n Word:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/198badfd-326c-4323-8996-d7eac3c92ee0\" alt=\"user notification\" style=\"width: 400px;\">\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

Version history allows users to see when and who made changes to a file and provides the ability to restore to a previous version of the file within the Office app. If there are conflicts within a file that does not require user input, Office will merge the conflicts and ensure that the Office file is up to date with the latest changes.

This reduces the chances of data disparity between different tools and allows security teams to conduct investigations with better accuracy.\n</li><li><i>Enhances the data pipeline for Advanced Hunting, resulting in improved performance and accuracy</i>: The migration will optimize data ingestion pipeline and proactive monitoring system of Advanced Hunting. This will lead to improved data freshness and reduce the chances of potential data quality issues in data pipeline.\n</li><li><i>Accelerates development cycles for new features built on the new data platform: </i>The modernized data architecture will enable faster iteration and deployment of new features. By reducing dependencies on legacy systems and adopting a scalable infrastructure, Microsoft can introduce feature enhancements more rapidly, bringing greater value to security analysts.\n</li><li><i>Strengthens proactive monitoring capabilities to minimize potential impact on customer workflows:</i> The new platform will enhance real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms, allowing for proactive detection and resolution of issues before they impact user workflows. Improved observability will ensure that any latency or disruptions are identified early, reducing downtime and improving system reliability.</li></ul><p><i>Potential impact</i></p><ul><li>No direct impact on customer data.\n</li><li>While the new platform brings significant improvements, users may experience slight delays in data availability (such as email metadata and post-delivery actions like quarantine release and manual remediation) in certain experiences, including Threat Explorer, Email Entity, and the Email Summary Panel.\n</li><li>In some cases, users may encounter intermittent failures for brief moment when loading the Email Summary Panel from experiences such as Quarantine and Submission immediately after an email is delivered.

These exempted senders will only be able to send emails exhibiting multiple From addresses without a Sender address header to recipients belonging to the same tenant as the sender. We will provide a subsequent update by the end of May 2025 (previously end of March) with an updated timeline for tenants that are opted out.</p><p>We're going to start gradually dropping messages that have multiple From addresses (also known as P2 From headers) without a Sender header from being processed via Exchange Online, please review the section \"When this will happen\" for rollout timeline information for your tenant.</p><p>If we see significant traffic exhibiting multiple From addresses (P2 From headers) without a Sender header in your tenant in the month of September, we will send you a Message Center Post by October 15th alerting you and providing some sample message IDs.</p><p>We are doing this to comply with <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2\" target=\"_blank\">RFC 5322 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#section-3.6.2)</a>&nbsp;which mandates the Sender header to be present and contain a single address if the From header has more than one address. Noncompliance with this could be exploited by attackers, allowing them to impersonate a sender address by misleading the client into using the From header to determine the sender instead of the Sender header.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out April 15, 2025, and expect to complete by May 15, 2025.</p><p>GCC High, DOD: We will begin rolling out July 1, 2025, and expect to complete by August 1, 2025.</p><p>We are delaying the rollout start date in order to provide more time to customers for investigating messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the traffic exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address will be inbound spam destined for your tenant sent by malicious spammers on the internet.\n</p><p>Some customers are sending legitimate emails with this malformed header configuration. On October 15, we sent a targeted MC post to customers showing high volumes of messages exhibiting multiple P2 From Addresses without a Sender Address as they may be impacted by this change.\n</p><p>For investigating if you will be impacted by this change, focus your investigation on messages sent using On Premises Inbound Connectors to Exchange Online. Authenticated mail submission is not impacted because submitting messages like this using those submissions are not allowed (Graph, Outlook clients, SMTP AUTH Client Submission).</p><p>[How this affects your organization:]\n</p><p>If email clients including devices and applications that you use to send messages, do so using multiple From addresses but without a Sender address header after the change starts rolling out to your environment, you will get an NDR error code 550 5.1.20 “Multiple From addresses are not allowed without Sender address.</p><p>[What you can do to prepare:]\n</p><p>When this change is in effect, if you need to send a message that has more than one email address in the From field, make sure that you have a single email address in the Sender header.\n</p><p>If you expect this change to cause any issues for your organization, please share that feedback.\n</p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>We are excited to announce a new capability in the Microsoft Teams admin center designed to ensure that device operations are non-disruptive for Android-based Teams devices.\n</p><p>This new feature allows software updates, restarts, and configuration updates to occur only when the device is idle (not busy), preventing any disruptions during meetings or calls. Device admins will now have the ability to manage these operations without affecting end-user experience, ensuring smoother and uninterrupted device usage.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=418120\" target=\"_blank\">418120</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out late February 2025 and expect to complete by early April 2025 (previously early March).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>This change will significantly enhance the user experience by ensuring that device operations such as software updates, restarts, and configuration updates are carried out only when the device is idle. This means meetings or calls will no longer be interrupted by these operations. This change will be applicable for Teams Rooms on Android, Panels, Phones, and Displays.\n</p><p>This change will require an update for Teams app and the Teams admin agent app to take effect. We will update this message closer to the release date with details about the required versions.\n</p><p>With this change, the following device operations will automatically function in a non-disruptive way:\n</p><ul><li>Software update\n</li><li>Device restart\n</li><li>Configuration update\n</li></ul><p>This change will be applicable for operations created by administrators manually from Teams admin center or the Teams Rooms Pro Management Portal, as well as those being carried out automatically.\n</p><p><u>How this will work:</u></p><p>At the time of execution, the device status is checked. The execution goes forward only if the device is free (no ongoing meeting or call) and has no upcoming scheduled event on the calendar.\n</p><p>A few minutes before the execution starts, the device shows a notification for the end-users, informing them that the operation is about to start. The device users get an option to Postpone the execution if they want to use the device.\n</p><p>The execution of the operation does not start if the device is busy, or has upcoming scheduled events on the calendar, or the end-user has opted to postpone the execution. The device status is checked at regular intervals for a safe window for execution.\n</p><p>The status of the operation is available in Teams admin center. Admins can view the details on the device page under the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/device-management#manage-phones-teams-rooms-on-android-teams-displays-and-teams-panels\" target=\"_blank\">History tab</a>.\n</p><p>This ensures that the end-users do not face any disturbance while they are using Teams devices.\n</p><p><u style=\"\">Additional aspects</u>\n</p><p>There could be scenarios where the devices are extremely busy thus delaying the execution of the operation. Administrators will have an option to decide the execution approach if the execution is unable to start even after 24 hrs. There are two options:\n</p><ul><li>The operation is cancelled after having tried for 24 hrs<b>.</b> There will be no impact on the device. If the administrator created this operation, they can come back can create it again. <u>This is the default behavior.\n</u></li><li>The operation is force-executed after having tried for 24 hrs. This option will execute the operation, but the status of the device will not be checked at this point. This may cause some disruption if the device is in use.\n</li></ul><p>The option to cancel or force the execution of the operations after the 24-hr search of a safe-execution window can be configured from Teams admin center through the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/device-management#use-configuration-profiles-in-teams\" target=\"_blank\" );\"=\"\">Configuration profiles</a>.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>The changes will take effect automatically after updating the devices to the required Teams app and Teams admin agent versions. The updates will happen automatically, but admins can choose to update manually also. The details about the required versions will be announced closer to the release date. Refer to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/devices/remote-update\" target=\"_blank\">Update Microsoft Teams devices remotely - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a> for more details about updating devices.\n</p><p>Admins should familiarize themselves with the new controls available in the Teams admin center. They should ensure that they configure the settings appropriately to suit their organization's needs. Additionally, it's recommended to communicate these changes to end-users, so they are aware of the improved experience and new notifications they might receive regarding device operations.\n</p><p>We believe this feature will greatly improve the reliability and user experience of Teams devices in your organization.\n</p><p>For any clarification, feel free to reach out to Microsoft Support.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

Like auto-apply retention labels, Priority Cleanup supports policy simulation mode, so administrators can check the returned samples in case the policy configuration needs any fine-tuning before enabling the policy. Once set-up, because the deletion by a priority cleanup policy is irreversible and can override existing holds, the process requires multiple approvals, specific roles, and is audited.

Please educate users that they should now type \"work\" in the address bar, hit the tab key, then type in their work-related query to get work results on a M365.cloud.microsoft page.\n</p><p>If your organization is using the <code>AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled</code> policy today, you should update to the <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code> policy, if the policy is still needed.   \n</p><p>The new policy, <code>AddressBarWorkSearchResultsEnabled</code>, will be available starting in early March, with Edge for Business version 134 (ahead of the Microsoft Search in Bing deprecation). This allows admins to configure the display of work suggestions in the address bar. If the policy is enabled or not configured, users who are signed into Edge for Business with their Entra ID can view internal work-related suggestions, such as bookmarks, files, and people results powered by Microsoft 365, in the Edge for Business address bar suggestion dropdown. If the policy is disabled, Entra ID signed-in users will not see internal workplace results in the Microsoft Edge address bar suggestion dropdown. \n</p><p>Admins who wish to set their own deprecation date prior to March 31, 2025, can turn off Microsoft Search in Bing by going to the Microsoft 365 admin center &gt; Settings &gt; Search &amp; Intelligence.\n</p><p>Regarding SafeSearch settings: \n</p><ul><li>If you had set the search experience for your organization to “School search,” SafeSearch was set to Strict by default.

Users who prefer to keep chat and channels separate can easily do so during the onboarding process or later, without IT assistance. </li><li>When the new experience is available for a user, a Get started screen is displayed. Users will have the option to defer the new experience up to three times over the course of approximately three days. About a week after the new experience is available for a user, they will be presented with a <b>final Get started screen</b> and transition to the new experience.</li><li>For users new to the experience on iOS, iPad, and Android,<b> message previews will be on by default. </b>For users new to the experience on Windows, Mac, and Web, message previews will be off by default.\n</li><li><b>A quick navigation bar for teams and channels</b> is available in Teams for Windows, Mac, and Web, at the bottom of the combined Chat view. Clicking on the bar will scroll the view to the teams and channels section for quick navigation. The bar displays in bold when there are unread messages in channels, or with indicators like \"@\" for unread @mentions in channels.\n</li></ul><p>Note: These updates will roll out to users in Public Preview and Targeted Release ahead of GA.</p><p>To help prepare organizations for the new features, product guides for admins and users are already available on the adoption web page https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/new-chat-and-channels-experience. Adoption content has been updated to reflect the above product improvements <a href=\"https://adoption.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/new-chat-and-channels-experience\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. We’ve been listening to user feedback on the pace of work and the challenges of keeping up with conversations, managing messages scattered across different locations, and triaging quickly.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon: A new license request feature and self-service purchase for Microsoft 365 Copilot will be widely available for all tenants. End user license request and self-service purchase will now be available for users with Microsoft 365 E1, Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft Office 365 Plan E1, Microsoft Office 365 Plan E3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E3, Enterprise Mobility + Security E5, Microsoft 365 Apps for Business and standalone products.  Both License request and self-service purchase will be shown within Microsoft 365 apps such as Copilot Chat, the unpaid version of work chat included in your Microsoft 365 subscription.  \n</p><p>\n</p><p>License Request allows users to request a Microsoft 365 Copilot license directly from their admin. This helps you efficiently assign unused licenses or purchase additional ones and assign based on user request. Global admins, license admins, and user admins will be able to manage these requests seamlessly in the Microsoft 365 admin center and can choose between standard or custom messaging, including directing to a third-party URL.</p><p>Self-Service Purchase allows users to purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses directly with their own credit card and use within their tenant with their Microsoft admin’s visibility and control. <b>Note: </b>If your organization has previously disabled self-service purchase for Microsoft 365 Copilot, your existing settings will be honored.</p><p>This message is related to MC853238 (Updated) Microsoft 365 admin center: New self-service purchase and trial settings (published August 2024, updated September 2024).

Thank you for your patience.\n</p><p>\n</p><p>Please note that information about meeting link expiry changes related to this rollout has been added.</p><p>We are reducing the length of Microsoft Teams meeting URLs for easier sharing. This rollout applies to all Microsoft Teams platforms (Teams for iOS, Android, Mac, Teams devices, desktop, and web).</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=381953\" target=\"_blank\">381953</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January) and expect to complete by late February 2025 (previously late January). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase.</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide, GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-May 2025 (previously mid-April) and expect to complete by late May 2025 (previously late April). Only Meet Now use cases (except Meet Now in chats and channels) will be affected in this timeframe. There will be no impact on the scheduled meetings in this phase. Rollout for scheduled meetings and channel Meet Now will be started in early July 2025 and expected to be completed by mid-July 2025. </p><p>General Availability (GCC High, DoD):&nbsp; We will begin rolling out early August 2025 (previously early June) and expect to complete by mid-August 2025 (previously late June).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>The new URL syntax is: https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/&lt;meeting_id&gt;?p=&lt;HashedPasscode&gt; \n</p><p>To make meeting URL shorter, we are removing several parameters such as tenant ID, conversation ID etc. This change serves two main goals: 1) improving usability of URL during sharing and 2) making the URL more secure and less susceptible to malicious attacks. \n</p><p>Here are some details about how meeting links work and when they expire: \n</p><ol><li>In case the meeting organizer gets removed from the tenant, the links to the meetings scheduled by them automatically expire. \n</li><li>&nbsp;Every meeting link expires in 60 days after the scheduled event or in 8 hours, if it was created as Meet Now. Learn more about expiration timelines for different types of meetings. \n</li></ol><p>With the Short Meeting URL release, expiration limit will be applied to all newly created links. \n</p><p>Once the change to Short Meeting URL is released, all newly created meetings will expire as described in the documentation: 60 days after meeting ends for scheduled meetings and 8 hours after creation for Meet Now. Once this expiry period is over, in case someone clicks the link (e.g. outside of Teams app OR in the meeting details inside Teams calendar section), they will be unable to join the meeting.</p><p>Note: Old links created before short meeting URL release will continue working as it previously was (user will be able to join even after the documented expiry limits).</p><p>The reason why we are making this change is simple: security is our topmost priority. Maintaining a high security level is essential to protect sensitive data, prevent financial losses, ensure business continuity, and meet compliance and legal obligations. It is a critical aspect of modern digital life and business operations. This adjustment is designed to enhance the security of Teams meeting links, thereby better safeguarding the customer tenant. We want to be on par with modern security standards, that’s why the new behavior is a step in the right direction that we must take. It’s not possible to keep the current behavior. If you think it breaks some of your business processes, please leave comment to the MC post and describe your case there. \n</p><p>Recommendations in case the meeting link has expired:  \n</p><p>For meeting organizer: We recommend scheduling a new meeting. If the meeting organizer got removed from the tenant someone else should reschedule their meetings from scratch. \n</p><p>For participant: Please reach out to the meeting organizer and ask them to reschedule the meeting or send you an updated link.</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>You may want to check if you have any integrations that use parameters from URL. After the rollout, the URL will only contain the meeting ID. Parameters such as tenant ID, organizer ID, conversation ID and message ID will not be in the URL. \n</p><p>You may inform meeting organizers from your tenant who use expired meeting links, or you may want to make a tenant-wide announcement about this change. \n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required. You may want to notify your users about this change and update any relevant documentation as appropriate.</p>",

The current behavior of the EWSEnabled flag is that it can be set at both the tenant (organization) level and the user (mailbox) level. Currently, when the flag is set to true at the user level, it takes precedence over the organization-level setting. If a setting is Null, it means the setting is not enforced at that level. If Org and user-level are both Null, the default behavior is to allow. This hierarchical structure means that if the organization-level flag is set to false, but the user-level flag is set to true, EWS requests from that user are still allowed. In summary:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>User Level&nbsp;</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This approach has led to situations where it can be challenging for administrators to ensure uniform policy enforcement across their organization, particularly in large and complex environments.</p><p>New Behavior\n</p><p>To address these issues, we are altering the behavior so that EWS will only be allowed if both the organization-level and user-level EWSEnabled flags are true. Here's a simplified view of the new logic:</p><table class=\"table table-bordered\"><tbody><tr><td>Organization Level</td><td>&nbsp;User Level</td><td>EWS Requests</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>True or &lt;null&gt;</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr><tr><td>False</td><td>False</td><td>Not Allowed</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In short, EWS will be permitted only if both the organization and user-level allow it. This change ensures that administrators have better control over EWS access and can enforce policies more consistently across their entire organization</p><p>[Next Steps:]\n</p><p>Please check the blog for additional information and ensure your per-user and tenant wide settings are correct before this change is made to your tenant. \n</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aka.ms/EWSEnabledChange\" target=\"_blank\">The way to control EWS usage in Exchange Online is changing</a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><b><br></b></p>",

Auto association can also keep up with the times by re-associating a peripheral if it gets physically moved to another room.</p><p _msttexthash=\"2141711\" _msthash=\"2425\">This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=469495\" target=\"_blank\">469495</a>.\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"474019\" _msthash=\"2424\">[When this will happen:]\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"5643534\" _msthash=\"2423\">Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 and expect to complete by mid-January 2025.\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"8338876\" _msthash=\"2422\">General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out in late January 2025 and expect to complete by late March 2025 (previously early February).\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"1207817\" _msthash=\"2421\">[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p _msttexthash=\"32433973\" _msthash=\"2420\"><b>For you: </b>Shared peripherals (peripherals used by multiple unique users who are in the office) will be automatically associated to your BYOD rooms in the Pro management portal.

Complete details can be found in this support article: <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>.\n</p><p><i>Action for admins</i>: The migration affects only Microsoft Azure-based Whiteboards. If your tenant does not have any Azure Whiteboards, this migration does not impact you. Check if your tenant has Azure Whiteboards using this PowerShell cmdlet: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/whiteboard/get-whiteboardsfortenant?view=whiteboard-ps\" target=\"_blank\">- Get-WhiteboardsForTenant</a>\n</p><p><i>Action item for users:</i> Until the migration completes. When your tenant receives the migration code, users can trigger a migration by starting a Whiteboard session from a web browser by simply going to <a href=\"https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://whiteboard.microsoft.com/</a> or by using a Whiteboard in their Teams meetings.</p><p>Whiteboard previously stored whiteboard files in Azure storage. In 2022, Whiteboard switched to OneDrive as the storage location for most newly created boards. We made a client-based migration available for your organization, which is currently rolling out gradually.&nbsp;</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=117394%2C\" target=\"_blank\">117394</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen]\n</p><p>The client-based migration experience started in December 2024 (previously July), and we expect to complete the migration by early June 2025.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization]\n</p><p>Any user who launches an eligible Whiteboard client (Whiteboard on Windows, Whiteboard in Teams desktop/web) will automatically kick off a non-blocking migration of all their whiteboards. Depending on how many whiteboards they have, on average the process will take between a few seconds to a few minutes.\n</p><p>The migration will provide many benefits for your organization and users on the migrated boards, including:\n</p><ul><li>Features unique to whiteboards stored in OneDrive, such as Follow, Commenting, and more.\n</li><li>Improved performance on whiteboards now stored in OneDrive.\n</li><li>Improved compliance and security associated with whiteboard being stored in OneDrive.\n</li></ul><p>There is no possibility to delay the migration.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare]\n</p><p>The migration will happen naturally and automatically for most users in your organization with no disruption, but please ensure that users are aware they need to launch Whiteboard in one of the previously mentioned clients in order to keep their content prior to the conclusion of the migration.\n</p><p>In the unlikely case that a user’s whiteboards fail to migrate, they will see an error banner. We will attempt to migrate the board again in 30 days. If the board contains important information, we recommend the user copy the content to a new whiteboard.\n</p><p>Users will be able to see which boards have not migrated in a dedicated section on the board picker. Admins will be able to verify what whiteboard content remains in Azure and obtain the userIDs via our PowerShell cmdlets, if you wish to proactively notify users to get their content.\n</p><p>Complete details about the migration can be found in <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/migration-of-whiteboards-from-azure-to-onedrive-6ddc6df1-540e-4b70-8e6a-541fafdc24f4\" target=\"_blank\">Migration of Whiteboards from Azure to OneDrive - Microsoft Support</a>, including how start and completion of migration will be notified, how errors will be communicated, and the new PowerShell cmdlets.</p>",

Non-Office files and PDF files stored on managed devices will be labeled while retaining their original file types to allow a user to modify and update the file on their device. When a user copies and uploads a labeled file to a destination external to their Windows device, EDLP will help enforce the rights protection by converting the file to a .pfile for secure sharing to other users.

The default value for this setting will be turned on or after March 8th if Fabric admins do not take any action.</p><p>This update helps enhance visibility and ease of access for our customers, ensuring you're aware of and can leverage this functionality effortlessly. \n</p><p>Note also, billing for compute usage and data storage for SQL databases in Fabric commenced after February 1st, with backup charges following after April 1st. For the latest updates on billing practices and to ensure you are fully informed on how charges are applied, please refer to the following detailed blog post: Monitor SQL database usage and consumption in Microsoft Fabric.</p><p>\n</p><p><i>Why are we updating this setting?</i></p><p><b>  \n</b></p><p>The update to our tenant settings is designed to ensure Fabric admins can act based on their organizational policy before the setting is enabled by default. From February 8, 2025, when the checkbox is available to March 8, 2025, admins can assess impact and act on enablement. By setting SQL database in Fabric as a default option, we ensure that you don’t miss out on leveraging its full potential right from the start. This change reflects our commitment to enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.</p><p>[When This Will Happen:]</p><p><b> \n</b></p><ol><li>The default activation of the checkbox for SQL database in Fabric is scheduled to commence on March 8th, 2025\n</li><li>Billing for compute and data storage for SQL databases in Fabric commenced after February 1, 2025.

If your organization prefers not to have this setting enabled by default, tenant admins must manually turn OFF this setting within the next 30 days.</li><li>We encourage you to assess these new settings and make any necessary changes to align with your organization's compliance and data storage policies.</li></ul></li><li>Review and Prepare for Billing Start:<ul><li>As billing for compute and data storage commenced after February 1, 2025, and backup charges will commence after April 1, 2025, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive review of your current and projected usage to anticipate charges.\n</li></ul></li></ol><p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our support team.</p>",

For tenants where the Anonymous users can join meetings option is disabled in meeting policy and admins would like to continue to block all unverified (anonymous) users joining meetings, admins should update the new meeting policy setting Anonymous users can join a meeting after verifying from “By e-mail code” to “No” by mid-February.  Without changing the default, this new feature introduces an additional way for unverified (anonymous) users to join meetings by e-mail code without needing an MSA or Entra account.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to Microsoft Teams: A new feature to enhance the security in external collaboration. If your company allows external domains to contact your users in Teams, we will identify if an external user is impersonating a brand commonly targeted by phishing attacks during their initial contact with your user through Teams Chat. If we detect potential impersonation, we will show a high-risk alert to the user, notifying them to check for suspicious name/email and proceed with caution.</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=421190\" target=\"_blank\">421190</a>.\n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out late October 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-November 2024 and expect to complete by mid-February 2025 (previously mid-January).</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>Before this rollout: For organizations that have enabled Teams external access, user can receive messages from any user from external domain. Teams does not scan the sender for impersonation risks. When a user receives a chat invitation, the user can accept, or block, or preview the message. <b>Note:</b> Previewing the message does not put the organization at risk.&nbsp;</p><p>After this rollout: If your organization enables Teams external access, we will check for potential impersonation activity when your user receives a message from an external sender for the first time. Your users will see a high-risk warning in the Accept/Block flow if we think there is potential impersonation risk, and users must preview the message before they can choose to Accept or block. If users choose to accept, we will prompt them again with potential risk before proceeding with Accept.\n</p><p>This security check will be done automatically. No admin configuration is required. Admins can check the audit log for impersonation attempts detected.\n</p><p>Teams detects an impersonation attempt in chat. In this case, the sender claims to be associated with Microsoft, but is not coming from a legitimate Microsoft domain: \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/81cde8c1-b573-44cc-9ab4-11ac14c133db\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>When a user selects <i>Preview their messages</i>&nbsp;in the first screen, and then selects <i>Accept,</i> the user is alerted again to the potential for risk in this screen: \n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/0f9c8322-06e4-480e-88a1-4579340ac5cb\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user settings\">\n</p><p>This feature will be on by default.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout. You may want to update any relevant documentation. We recommend that you educate your users on what the new high-risk Accept/Block screen means and remind users to proceed with caution.\n</p><p>Before rollout, we will update this post with revised documentation.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>Updated January 15, 2025: We have updated the rollout timeline below. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Yammer is committed to strengthening the alignment of Yammer to Microsoft 365. This means we will no longer support tenants having more than one non-external Yammer network. This change will ensure Yammer networks have the same organizational boundaries as their corresponding Microsoft 365 tenants.\n</p><p><i>Why is this happening now?\n</i></p><p>Integrating Yammer more fully into the Microsoft 365 ecosystem has been a multi-year effort. New 1:many configurations have not been permitted since October 2018. All new Yammer networks provisioned after January 2020 have been created in Native Mode. In September 2022, <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">the enforcement of Native Mode was announced</a>. Automated network consolidation is an important prerequisite to reaching Native Mode and gaining access to broader safety, security, and compliance features. \n</p><p>[When this will happen:]\n</p><p>Starting on May 1, 2023 and continuing through early March 2025 (previously January 1). You are welcome to initiate network consolidation on your own at any time before or after May 1, 2023.\n</p><p>[How this will affect your organization:]\n</p><p>With automated network consolidation, you will lose access to all your secondary Yammer networks. Users from your secondary Yammer networks will be migrated to your primary network, but <b><i><u>groups and data will be lost.</u></i></b> In advance of this change, we strongly recommend that customers perform a full data export of their networks. You can read more about exporting data from your network <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/manage-security-and-compliance/export-yammer-enterprise-data\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>It is strongly advised that customers <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/yammer/configure-your-yammer-network/faq-consolidate-multiple-yammer-networks\" target=\"_blank\">perform this network consolidation themselves</a>.  This will allow you to choose the time of the consolidation and allow the administrator to choose which primary domain will be associated with the remaining network.\n</p><p>There are Microsoft partners that can help you migrate data from your secondary networks. Please reach out to your Microsoft Account Team or <a href=\"https://products.office.com/yammer/partners\" target=\"_blank\">contact a partner</a> for more information.\n</p><p>Post-consolidation of the networks into 1:1 alignment with Microsoft 365, they will be upgraded to Native Mode. This provides access to the latest features in Yammer and ensures that Yammer and Viva Engage content is included in Microsoft Purview's compliance and security features.\n</p><p>You can read more about our plans to ensure alignment to Native Mode <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/yammer-blog/non-native-and-hybrid-yammer-networks-are-being-upgraded/ba-p/3612915\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n</p><p>[What you need to do to prepare:]\n</p><p><i>If you would like to self-initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>There is a guide to network consolidation available to walk you through the process. A network administrator can run the network migration tool from within Yammer.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you would like Microsoft to initiate your network consolidation:\n</i></p><ul><li>You are not required to take any action. Microsoft will notify you via the M365 Message Center of your scheduled consolidation date and default primary network and domain. The network with the highest total message count will be the default primary network. \n</li><li>If you would like a different default primary network, contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.\n</li></ul><p><i>If you need to postpone or schedule network consolidation around blackout dates:\n</i></p><ul><li>Contact Microsoft 365 support to log an exception.  \n</li></ul><p><br></p>",

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Coming soon to the Microsoft Viva Engage adoption community for Microsoft 365 Copilot, users will receive recommendations of similar questions and answers when composing a question, leveraging the collective knowledge of the Copilot topic across all of Engage to help them find what they're looking for faster. Additionally, admins will have the ability to remove adoption features from the existing community and apply them to a new or different community.</p><p>Since general availability in August 2024 (referenced in MC784156), network admins and corporate communicators can enable a new type of community specifically built to facilitate the rollout and adoption of Copilot in their organizations. This community can bring employees together in a community of practice where employees can ask questions, seek support from both their peers and IT admins, share best practices, and learn more from articles and quick tips on how best to use Copilot.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-January 2025 (previously early January) and expect to complete by mid-February 2025 (previously early February).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>When composing a question in the Copilot adoption community, users will soon have access to a new feature that provides a list of recommended similar questions<b> </b>that have been asked and answered across all of Viva Engage. Users will soon be able to quickly navigate to existing answers, contribute to recommended questions, or post a new question, leveraging the collective knowledge across their network to find information faster and more efficiently.</p><p>Admins who want to remove adoption features from the existing community and apply them to a new or different community can do so by navigating to the ellipses (...) menu on the right side of the community header and selecting <i>Unmark Copilot community</i>. This action will remove all adoption features, including suggested content, suggested members, and the setup checklist, while retaining all other content.</p><p>This update is available by default.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>There is no required action for admins before the rollout. If your organization is working on rollout and adoption of Copilot, we recommend reading the support documentation to learn more about this new capability in Viva Engage and connecting with the Copilot change managers in your organization to include this in your rollout and adoption change management plan.</p><p>Learn more:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-engage-blog/new-features-in-viva-engage-help-you-rollout-and-adopt-copilot/ba-p/4110449\" target=\"_blank\">New features in Viva Engage help you rollout and adopt Copilot - Microsoft Community Hub</a></li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/viva/engage/engage-365-copilot-adoption-platform\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption community in Viva Engage | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul>",

Through the new <b><i>Feature Access management user interface</i></b>, admins will be able to manage feature access settings directly in the MAC.

      "Content": "<p>Updated December 18, 2024: We've delayed further rollouts of warning banners and blocking pages in December and intend to resume in mid-January per the schedule below. Please review for updated information and timing.</p><p>In today’s security climate, our work across the company and greater industry to keep this critical ecosystem secure is more important than ever. And while we also ship bug fixes and other new features via continuous innovation, in the end security is job one.\n</p><p>Keeping Microsoft Teams up to date is critical to ensure your devices are secure and compliant.  By default, and as designed, Teams updates automatically which successfully updates most clients in the world without additional overhead for customers. \n</p><p>Microsoft Teams is governed by the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/policies/modern\" target=\"_blank\">Modern Lifecycle Policy</a> which requires that the Teams desktop client be kept up to date.  This is not a new policy, for instance in MC298823 (November 2021), a version that is far out of date will become incompatible with the service until it’s updated.  As <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#servicing-agreement\" target=\"_blank\">documented</a>, when a client falls out of date, the user will see:\n</p><ul><li>Recurring in-app alerts, if the app is between 30d-90d out of date. Except in VDI environments, where this will occur between 60-90 days out of date.</li><li>A blocking page in Teams, if the app is greater than 90 days out of date.  At this point, the app will show options to update, to contact their IT administrator, or continue to Teams on the web.  \n</li></ul><p>As an example, if the Teams app is hypothetically on a version released on January 1 and the next update is fully available on January 15, an in-app alert would be shown on February 14th (30 days after the January 15th update).  \n</p><p>For reference, link to the Teams app's  <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/officeupdates/teams-app-versioning\" target=\"_blank\">version's release dates</a>.  Also, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/new-teams-usage-report\" target=\"_blank\">The Microsoft Teams desktop client usage report</a> gives you an overview of the Teams desktop clients in use within your organization.\n</p><p>Classic Teams is not in scope for this post; see MC783985 for Classic Teams Timelines regarding end of support and end of availability.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>The existing policy enforcement will be visible beginning January 14th, 2025.</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>New Teams - Windows &amp; Mac Versions desktop clients (not running in a VDI environment)</p><ul><li>Beginning January 14th, 2025, Teams desktop clients more than 30 days out of date, will present a banner or notification to users that they are on an outdated version of Teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Beginning February 18th, 2025, Teams desktop clients older than 90 days out of date, will present a blocking page. They will be shown an option to update to the latest version of Teams from <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a> or use Teams on the web.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>New Teams app running in a VDI environment – Windows desktop clients will follow the same policies as non-VDI environments, with enforcement starting on dates below&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Beginning March 11th, 2025, for clients more than 60 days out of date will get a banner or notification to users that they are on an outdated version of Teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Beginning May 6th, 2025, for clients older than 90 days out of date, the Teams desktop client will present a blocking page.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Note on Deployment of Changes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Users in preview rings will experience the changes approximately 4 weeks before the specified dates (for app versions released to that ring).&nbsp;</li><li>The experiences above will not be visible to all users right away. It will take 4-8 weeks for the deployment to reach all users.&nbsp;</li></ul><p> <b>What you can do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To avoid disruption to end-users, the admins with users on Teams versions older than the currently released versions, should update their users to the most recent version. \n</p><p>Admins should make sure Teams is automatically updating to stay current and within the compatibility window.  Common configurations to validate include:\n</p><ul><li>Teams clients on macOS have Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) configured properly.  <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-client-update#updating-teams-on-mac-devices\" target=\"_blank\">Learn More</a>\n</li><li>Customer network settings, and any device management software e.g. antivirus, are configured properly to allow automatic updates.\n</li><li>Windows <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/troubleshoot/teams-administration/fix-new-teams-installation-issues#policy-settings-prevent-download-and-installation\" target=\"_blank\">Policies</a> must not block new Teams or the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/concepts/enterprise\" target=\"_blank\">Webview2 updater</a>.\n</li></ul><p>Please visit <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-client-update\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a> to learn more.</p>",

To use the new Message trace functionality through the PowerShell cmdlet Get-MessageTraceV2, please ensure you are using version 3.7.0 or later of the Exchange Online PowerShell V3 module.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out mid-December 2024 and expect to complete by late December 2024.\n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p><b>Key functionality changes</b>\n</p><ul><li>Extended query range: You can query up to 90 days of historical data for near real-time queries. However, please note that you can only query 10 days of data at a time. Please note that you will initially only have 30 days of historical data for near real-time query, and this will build over time to 90 days of historical data.\n</li><li>Subject filter: You can select a subject filter for Message trace queries, such as <i>Starts with, Ends with, </i>and <i>Contains</i> functions. This filter also supports special characters.\n</li><li>Delivery status filter: The delivery status filter will now support searches for <i>Quarantined, Filtered as spam, </i>and <i>Getting status</i> statuses.\n</li></ul><p><i>Additional updates</i>\n</p><ul><li>Customizable columns: For your search results, we’ve introduced customizable columns and added additional column options. <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/announcing-public-preview-of-the-new-message-trace-in-exchange-online/4356561\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the new columns</a>.\n</li><li>Persistent column widths: You will be able to customize your column widths, and these changes will persist in each logged-on admin account, so you will not have to reset column widths each time you run a new Message trace query. This update is still in progress and will be made available in early-February.\n</li><li>Wider flyout option: An option for a wider flyout for the Message trace detail will be available.\n</li><li>Time zone consistency: Message trace will default to the time zone set in the Exchange account settings of the logged-on admin.\n</li></ul><p><b>Key cmdlet changes in </b><code>Get-MessageTraceV2</code> (relative to <code>Get-MessageTrace</code>)\n</p><ul><li>Extended query range: You can query up to 90 days of historical data.

The ERR limit is being introduced to help reduce unfair usage and abuse of Exchange Online resources.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>The new ERR limit will be introduced in 2 phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1 - Starting January 1, 2025, the limit will apply to cloud-hosted mailboxes of all newly created tenants.</li><li>Phase 2 - Between July and December 2025, we will start applying the limit to cloud-hosted mailboxes of existing tenants.</li></ul><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>Exchange Online enforces a Recipient Rate limit of 10000 recipients for cloud-hosted mailboxes. The 2000 ERR limit will become a sublimit within this 10000 Recipient Rate limit. There is no change to the Recipient Rate limit, and both of these will be rolling limits for 24-hour windows. You can send to up to 2,000 external recipients in a 24-hour period, and if you max out the external recipient rate limit then you will still be able to send to up to 8,000 internal recipients in that same period. If you don't send to any external recipients in a 24-hour period, you can send to up to 10,000 internal recipients.</p><p>For example:\n</p><ul><li>You use a cloud-hosted mailbox to send to 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients at 6:00AM on Day 1, for a total of 3,000 recipients. You then send to another 1,000 external recipients at 8:00AM on Day 1. Because you sent to 2,000 external recipients, you will be blocked from sending to external recipients until 6:00AM on Day 2. During this period, you are able to send to up to 6,000 internal recipients, but for this example, let's assume that you don't.\n</li><li>At 6:00AM on Day 2, the 1,000 external recipients and 2,000 internal recipients sent at 6:00AM on Day 1 will no longer count toward the 24-hour limit calculation. Thus, from 6:00-8:00AM on Day 2, you can send to up to 9,000 total recipients (e.g., 9,000 internal or 8,000 internal plus 1,000 external).\n</li><li>If you don't send to any internal or external recipients during this period, then at 8:00AM on Day 2 you can again send to 10,000 recipients total with up to 2,000 of them being external recipients.</li></ul><p>\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>If you have a cloud-hosted mailbox that needs to exceed the ERR limit, you can move to <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Communication Services for Email</a>, which is designed specifically for high volume email sent to recipients external to your tenant.</p>",

      "Content": "<p>As noted in MC958903, we are updating the Microsoft 365 app name and icon to Microsoft 365 Copilot in mid-January 2025. In addition, we are evolving the app's UI to support future AI-first experiences. Key changes include reducing the top app header, consolidating all app-level tools and settings into the App toolbar on the left, and retiring features like Help me create and My Day from the app.\n</p><p><b>When will this happen:</b>\n</p><p>These changes will begin rolling out in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app (web, Windows) starting in mid-January 2025. This is a phased rollout, so not all users will receive the update simultaneously.\n</p><p><b>How will this affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>With these updates, users will notice the following changes:\n</p><ul><li>The app will no longer have a top header. Instead, tools like user profile, settings, and feedback will move to the bottom left toolbar. The feedback button will be available under the 'Settings and more' section in the bottom left toolbar.\n</li><li>The search box will now be presented on the Homepage for users to find all their content across multiple file types and storage locations. Note: There is no change to the search experience—only the placement of the feature.\n</li><li>All the apps on the left tool bar are aligned to the top and the AI rich experiences like Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and Copilot Pages will be presented together to establish correlation.\n</li><li>The organization logo, previously displayed in the top header under the Organization theme, will no longer be visible in the app. Note: This change does not affect other Microsoft 365 apps where the organization logo will still appear in the header.\n</li><li>The 'Back' button on the Windows Microsoft 365 Copilot app will not be available. Users will still be able to use the left AppBar to navigate between pages. \n</li><li>The 'My Day' feature is being removed from the app experience, and users will no longer see the button to launch the calendar and to-do on the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Note: This change does not affect other Microsoft 365 apps where My Day feature is available.\n</li><li>The 'Help me create' feature will be retired from the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. Launched in February 2024, ‘Help me create’ was focused on helping users go from their stated intent to document creation using an LLM. With Microsoft 365 Copilot app becoming the destination for Copilot, we will be bringing AI powered document creation into Copilot tab. Users will be able to brainstorm ideas and draft new content based on a storyboard or a script to an agenda or an executive summary from Copilot Chat.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>No admin or user action is required as these changes roll out. However, we recommend keeping your users informed about these updates to ensure they are aware that these changes are part of the app enhancements.</p>",

To allow ample time for replacing URLs, connector owners will have until <b>January 31, 2025, which is an extension from our previous deadline of December 31, 2024.</b> See below for complete guidance.</p><p>Webhook-based connectors within the O365 Connectors service in Teams are transitioning to a new URL structure due to the implementation of further service hardening updates. During this transition, you may receive notifications to update your configured connector to use the new URL. We strongly recommend that you update your connector immediately to prevent any disruption to connector services. URLs for all webhook-based connectors must be updated by January 31, 2025 for the connectors to continue posting messages into Teams. <b>Keep in mind the entire O365 Connectors service in Teams will be retired at the end of 2025</b>, so consider moving your webhooks to the Workflows app within Teams to avoid conducting another migration. Documentation: <a href=\"https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/office/create-incoming-webhooks-with-workflows-for-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498\" target=\"_blank\">Create incoming webhooks with Workflows for Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Support</a></p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>This change is needed only for webhook-based Connectors such as Incoming Webhook and third-party connectors where a URL is provided for posting messages. The change is not required for polling-based connectors such as RSS.</p><p>To update webhook URLs for existing O365 Connectors, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/m365-custom-connectors#update-connectors-url\" target=\"_blank\">Manage Microsoft 365 connectors and custom connectors - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Learn</a></p><p>1. Go to<b> Manage Channel</b> in a Teams channel, select<b> Edit</b> under the Connectors option, and select <b>Configured </b>section. Review the existing connections listed on this page.</p><p>2.Do one of the following to generate a new URL:</p><ul><li>For connectors that contain a webhook URL, select <b>Manage</b> and <b>Update URL.</b></li><li>For other types of connectors, remove the connector and recreate the connector configuration.</li></ul><p>3. Replace the old URL with the new URL (or the new connection in the service that triggers the post). You'll know the new URL is ready for you to copy when the Configure page shows a message that the URL is updated (\"Url is up-to-date\").</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/1f25c2c0-1a9e-49af-8c81-26fb2bc3252c\" style=\"width: 410px;\"><br></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>The below dates are still unchanged and were communicated in previous updates:</p><ul><li>Entire O365 Connector service in Teams will retire in December 2025.</li><li>Developers will no longer be able to create new Office 365 Connectors from the Developer Portal starting August 15th, 2024.</li></ul><p>Additional documentation:</p><p><a href=\"https://prod.support.services.microsoft.com/office/create-incoming-webhooks-with-workflows-for-microsoft-teams-8ae491c7-0394-4861-ba59-055e33f75498\" target=\"_blank\">Create incoming webhooks with Workflows for Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Support</a></p><p><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/browse-and-add-workflows-in-microsoft-teams-4998095c-8b72-4b0e-984c-f2ad39e6ba9a#:~:text=Workflows%20let%20you%20automate%20repetitive%20tasks%20or%20processes\" target=\"_blank\">Browse and add workflows in Microsoft Teams - Microsoft Support</a></p><p><b>Note about parity features for the Workflows app</b></p><p>We are currently developing a method for webhooks in the Workflow app to support the following scenarios and will share more details before March 30, 2025.</p><ul><li>Post messageCard formatted message payloads (so you do not have to reformat the payload to adaptive card)</li><li>Post to private channels</li></ul>",

If the device is identified in the PMP, the roster group will display the configured meeting room name.\n</p><p>This message applies to Teams for Windows and Mac desktops.\n</p><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&amp;searchterms=413711\" target=\"_blank\">413711</a>.\n</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b>\n</p><p>Targeted Release: We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 (previously early October) and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously mid-October).&nbsp;</p><p>General Availability (Worldwide): We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024.\n</p><p>General Availability (GCC): We will begin rolling out mid-October 2024 and expect to complete by late December (previously late November).&nbsp;</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>Before this rollout: Users joining a Teams meeting from a BYOD meeting room will be displayed as an individual participant in the <i>Participants </i>roster. Room node treatments will only be applicable to users joining from a Microsoft Teams Room.\n</p><p>After this rollout, this update will be available by default for all users joining a Teams meeting from a BYOD meeting room. After joining, in-room participants will automatically be grouped under the room node on the Participant roster. The two scenarios in which in-room participants can be ungrouped from the room node are:\n</p><ul><li>Raised hand: We will continue to follow the sequential order of raised hands on the roster. In-room participants who use their companion device to raise their hand will appear on the roster in the order in which they raised their hand.\n</li><li>Role assignment: For changes in roles (presenters and attendees), in-room participants can be broken up and placed in the appropriate category on the roster. (This is an existing feature before this rollout.)\n</li></ul><p>In both scenarios, room information will be listed below participant name.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/056880c5-1278-43d2-ab99-71328129c8c6\" style=\"width: 400px;\" alt=\"user controls\">\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>This rollout will happen automatically by the specified date with no admin action required before the rollout.

If you are currently following this guidance,<b> this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</b></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.

To set up bookable desks, admins must associate these devices to a workspace account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Similarly, to set up <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/rooms/bring-your-own-device\" target=\"_blank\">BYOD rooms</a> (rooms without Microsoft Teams Rooms that are equipped with devices such as a speaker puck or other peripherals), admins must associate these devices to a room account through the Teams Rooms Pro Management portal. Finally, in order for a user’s work location to be updated to a specific building, an admin must onboard their buildings<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/places/get-started/quick-setup-buildings-floors?branch=main\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a>and parent the workspace or room resource account to the buildings.</p><p>After these steps are complete, admins have the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/new-csteamsworklocationdetectionpolicy?view=teams-ps\" target=\"_blank\">option to opt-in</a> for automatic location updates. This can be enabled at a tenant level or for a specific user group. Once admins have enabled this feature, users will have the opportunity to opt-in. They can do so in Teams under <i>Settings &gt; Privacy</i>. After users have opted-in, their work location will automatically update to a specific building when they connect to a bookable desk or BYOD room. Note that if a workspace or room resource account does not have a building, the user's work location will automatically update to “In the office” upon plug-in rather than update to the specific building</p><p>To facilitate discovery of this feature, after tenant opt-in, the following banner will be shown the first time a user plugs into a bookable desk or BYOD room.</p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/be3a63d0-1058-4050-8164-a97cfc72fb47\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><br></p><p>Once a user enables automatic location updates, the following banner will be displayed only once for the user’s convenience and confirmation that the location update was successful on their first subsequent plug-in to bookable desks or BYOD room.</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8f79a81e-12b8-40bf-a935-c730b7c0c832\" style=\"width: 550px;\"><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"><br></span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\"> \n</span></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>To prepare for this feature, we strongly recommend communicating this new feature to your users and admin team and sharing instructions if needed. Please note that if an admin or user had previously opted in when the automatic work location detection only updated to “In the office” (MC808158), there is no additional setting to enable for one’s work location be automatically updated with building information.

Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Microsoft Purview: We are excited to announce upcoming enhancements to Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP). With the forthcoming update, the capability to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows endpoint devices will be significantly expanded. The number of supported file types will increase from approximately 40 to over 100, aligning endpoint coverage with other platforms like Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive. Additionally, this update will introduce several key enhancements, including:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Detection of labels from protected files (pfiles).\n</li><li>Identification of sensitive content within file metadata.\n</li><li>Recognition of sensitive information in PDF form fields.</li><li>Detection of sensitive information in files embedded inside office files (for example, a .txt file inside .pptx file)</li></ul><p>This message is associated with Microsoft 365 Roadmap ID <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=1%26filters=&amp;searchterms=171586\" target=\"_blank\">171586</a></p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>Public Preview: We will begin rolling out late June (previously late July) 2024 and expect to complete by late October 2024 (previously early October).</p><p>General Availability Worldwide: We will begin rolling out early November 2024 (previously late October) and expect to complete by mid-March 2025 (previously late mid-February.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>The upcoming update will enhance DLP's content scanning on Windows devices. No changes to existing policies are required.</p><p>Summary of enhancements:</p><p>1.\tEnhanced file type coverage\n</p>\n\n<p>The file type coverage to scan, classify, and protect sensitive content on Windows Endpoint devices will increase from 40 file types to over 100. \n</p><p>This means that sensitive content in additional file types like BZ2, EML etc. will also start getting scanned and protected using DLP policies.</p><p>\n</p>\n\n<p>2.\tDetect label in PFILE</p><p>The DLP condition \"content contains sensitivity label\" now has the capability to detect labels from protected files (pfiles). This means that it can now read labels not just from Office and PDF files, but all other files where MIP label with protection can be applied via applications like AIP client, Secude etc. which converts the file into “pfile”.</p><p>Picture 1:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/8c4d2426-7164-4710-900b-2bd8667b59ca\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>A txt file converted to .ptxt (PFile) after applying a label. This label can now be detected with this preview.\n</p>\n\n<p>3.\tScanning metadata\n</p>\n\n<p>Ability to detect sensitive content in file metadata like custom properties in Office and PDF files.</p><p>Picture 2:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/22b5d8fe-a5ef-4d5e-b810-a74f9ea7dc49\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>4.\tScanning content embedded in Microsoft 365 office files\n</p>\n\n<p>If a file is embedded inside an office file (Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint), the content of the embedded file is also scanned. For example, if a DOCX file containing credit card numbers is inserted into an XLSX file, the content of both XLSX and the embedded DOCX files will be scanned, and credit card numbers will be detected.\n</p><p>Picture 3:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/cab0da75-319b-40bc-967f-b8c6766611e7\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p>5.\tBetter scanning with PDF files\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in PDF forms.\n</p>\n\n<p>·\tAbility to scan and detect sensitive content in permission protected PDF files. Permission protected PDF files are ones which do not require any password to open the file and read the content but require a password to edit/copy the content.\n</p>\n\n<p>Picture 4:</p><p><img src=\"https://cxcs.microsoft.net/file/messagecenter/en-us/453bd3df-d597-4e9d-ab89-43f90a87f4f8\" style=\"width: 400px;\"></p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>You do not need do any changes to your existing policies.

With Copilot Pages, you can turn insightful Copilot responses into something durable with a side-by-side page that you can view and edit and, when ready, share with your team to collaborate. \n</p><p>In a multiplayer approach, you can work together as a team to learn from each other’s prompts, and organize complex information. We see collaboration using Copilot Pages as the next great step forward in evolving Copilot from an individual, point-in-time exercise into a collaborative experience. \n</p><p>You can return to a page at any time by clicking the link in chat or the Open Page icon at the top of the associated Copilot session. Additionally, users can view all their pages in the Pages module in Microsoft365.com where they can also collaborate with others. \n</p><p>Created pages are stored in a user-owned SharePoint Embedded container. The container is lifetime-managed with the user account, so like OneDrive, the container and its content are deleted when the user account is deleted.\n</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><p>The feature will be automatically enabled when it rolls out unless you’ve used the following controls to manage the experience. If you wish to change the configuration of the feature, there are two ways to consider based on your needs.\n</p><p>You can use a Cloud Policy setting to prevent users from creating new Copilot pages in Microsoft Copilot, and/or use Conditional Access or Information Barriers policies to block certain users from accessing Copilot pages as needed.\n</p><p>Note: The controls for Copilot pages are the same for both free Microsoft Copilot (when signed in with an Entra account) and the paid Microsoft 365 Copilot license.\n</p><p>More information can be found here: <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-copilot/copilot-pages-for-it-admins-sep-2024-update/ba-p/4241521\" target=\"_blank\">Copilot pages for IT Admins - Sep 2024 update</a>\n</p><p>Instructions for using the Cloud Policy to enable/disable Copilot pages in your tenant repeated here for ready reference:\n</p><ol><li>Sign in to <a href=\"https://config.office.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://config.office.com/</a>&nbsp;with your Microsoft 365 admin credentials.\n</li><li>Select <b>Customization </b>from the left pane.\n</li><li>Select <b>Policy Management</b>.\n</li><li>Create a new policy configuration or edit an existing one.\n</li><li>From the <b>Choose the scope </b>dropdown list, choose either <b>All users </b>or select the group for which you want to apply the policy.

      "Content": "<p>Updated October 18, 2024: We have updated the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center, adding the Authentication Protocol column to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. The data will build up over the next 90 days. Thank you for your patience.</p><p>Today, we are announcing that Exchange Online will permanently remove support for Basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) in September 2025. After this time, applications and devices will no longer be able to use Basic auth as an authentication method and must use OAuth when using SMTP AUTH to send email.\n</p><p>Basic auth is a legacy authentication method that sends usernames and passwords in plain text over the network. This makes it vulnerable to credential theft, phishing, and brute force attacks. To improve the protection of our customers and their data, we are retiring Basic auth from Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) and encouraging customers to use modern authentication methods that are more secure.</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>We will be making this change in September 2025.</p><p> \n</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b>\n</p><p>In September 2024, we will update the SMTP AUTH Clients Submission Report in the Exchange admin center to show if Basic auth or OAuth is being used to submit email to Exchange Online. In January 2025, we will send a Message Center post to tenants who are using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to alert them to the upcoming change. In August 2025, about 30 days before we disable Basic auth we will send another Message Center post to tenants who are still using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH).\n</p><p>During September 2025, we will remove support for Basic auth with the Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) endpoints:\n</p><ul><li>smtp.office365.com \n</li><li>smtp-legacy.office365.com \n</li></ul><p>Once Basic auth is permanently disabled, any clients or apps connecting using Basic auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) will receive this response:\n</p><ul><li>550 5.7.30 Basic authentication is not supported for Client Submission.\n</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><p>If your client supports OAuth, follow these steps: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth\" target=\"_blank\">Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth</a></p><p>If your client doesn’t support OAuth and you must use Basic Auth with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH), you will need to switch to one of the following alternatives before September 2025:</p><ul><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal to your tenant, you can use Microsoft 365 High Volume Email. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/high-volume-mails-m365\" target=\"_blank\">Manage high volume emails for Microsoft 365 Public preview</a></li><li>If you are using basic authentication with Client Submission (SMTP AUTH) to send emails to recipients internal and external to your tenant, you can use Azure Communication Services Email. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Overview of Azure Communication Services email</a></li><li> If you have an Exchange Server on-premises in a hybrid configuration, you can use Basic auth to authenticate with the Exchange Server on-premises or configure the Exchange Server on-premises with a Receive connector that allows anonymous relay on Exchange servers. Please visit this site to learn more: <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/mail-flow/connectors/allow-anonymous-relay?view=exchserver-2019\" target=\"_blank\">Allow anonymous relay on Exchange servers</a></li></ul><p>Regardless of the volume of email, if you must use Basic auth to send email with Exchange Online, then you must use one of the alternatives.</p><p>We understand that this change requires some adjustments, but we believe that this is a necessary step to enhance the security and reliability of our email service and your data.\n</p><p><br></p>",

To overcome this block, Outlook for the web will present a banner for the user to refresh their session. This will enable navigation to Entra ID to refresh their token. SSO-enabled Windows devices are expected to silently sign in users with SSO without requiring further interaction and will not display the banner. This issue affects Outlook for web users.

Very large tenants will take longer.  While the index is provisioning, search requests will only return shared and public content.  Once the new index is complete, private and shared content will be returned.  If no additional search requests for private content are sent within 100 days, the private index will be decommissioned.

If you are currently following this guidance, <i>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</i></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b><br></p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

This sample script is designed to simplify the migration process for IT admins and to ensure that your users' unsynchronized data is backed up during migration. We believe this migration guidance will significantly help in achieving a successful migration process.\n</p><p><i>2. OneNote migration support in October 2024:</i>\n</p><p>To ensure a smooth transition, we are offering additional support from the OneNote team to help with the migration process for tenants who want to migrate early. The team is only available in the month of October 2024. After that, you will need to rely on the deployment guidance. To engage the OneNote team in October 2024, please provide feedback as usual on this post and include your email address.\n</p><p><i>3. App download restrictions for new users:</i></p><p>Starting November 1, 2024, new users will no longer be able to download OneNote for Windows 10 from the Microsoft Store. Given the app is approaching end of support and we are recommending using OneNote for Windows instead, we’re restricting new users from being able to install OneNote for Windows 10 moving forward. If you currently have the application installed, you will still be able to use it and receive updates until the end of support.\n</p><p>We are committed to supporting you through this transition and ensuring that your migration to OneNote for Windows is as seamless as possible.\n</p><p><i>Learn more\n</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/XPFFZHVGQWWLHB?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_blank\">Download OneNote for Windows</a> from the Microsoft Store\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-is-happening-to-onenote-for-windows-10-2b453bfe-66bc-4ab2-9118-01e7eb54d2d6#:~:text=We%20recently%20announced%20the%20availability%20of%20the%20OneNote,Windows%2010%20will%20reach%20end-of-support%20in%20Oct%202025.\" target=\"_blank\">What is happening to OneNote for Windows 10 - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/office/moving-to-onenote-on-windows-4ba7b498-aafc-44b1-8326-a582a6c71196\" target=\"_blank\">Moving to OneNote on Windows - Microsoft Support</a>\n</li><li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/deployment-guide-onenote\" target=\"_blank\">Deployment guide for OneNote - Microsoft 365 Apps | Microsoft Learn</a></li></ul><p></p>",

If you are currently following this guidance, <i>this change should not impact users in your organization using the above applications under the new domain.\n</i></li><li>Users will be redirected to applications under cloud.microsoft domains gradually and automatically. No specific user action is required. Links to the previous domains are backwards compatible and continue to be supported. Users may notice that the new application domains are lacking the “.com” extension.  This is by design, as “.microsoft” is Microsoft’s own top-level domain – and this exclusivity allows for additional security and protection against spoofing.</li></ul><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b>\n</p><ul><li>Educate users to recognize and expect cloud.microsoft as a key domain for Microsoft cloud experiences.

However, it would be good practice to update those assets to avoid user confusion.\n</li><li>Partner with developers of in-house Teams apps - including those that run on Outlook and Microsoft 365 - to take the actions described in <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/action-required-ensure-your-microsoft-teams-apps-are-ready-for-upcoming-domain-changes/\" target=\"_blank\">Action required: ensure your Microsoft Teams apps are ready for upcoming domain changes</a> so the apps continue to function on the new domain. \n</li><li>Admins should ensure that connections to *.cloud.microsoft are not blocked from their clients and enterprise networks.

We have concluded  through  customer feedback that this change to our initial deprecation plan, by maintaining support   for Live Events, will empower customers to produce large events as established and provide more time to upgrade to town hall, our new digital streaming event solution for large events, on their own schedule. Town hall will continue to serve as the platform where we will deliver new product value to our customers.</p><p>Teams Live Events will continue to be supported. We want to ensure that customers can upgrade to town hall on their own schedule as we work to bring new features and capabilities to town hall.  Town  hall is already available for commercial customers in public clouds, and we are adding new features regularly.</p><p>If you are using Teams Live Events for your large-scale digital events, you can continue to do so past the previously announced deprecation date of September 30th, 2024. However, we encourage you to try town hall, which offers a more modern and interactive experience for your live events.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to do anything at this time to continue using Teams Live Events. If you have directed your organization to not schedule Live Events after September due to the deprecation announcement, you may now schedule Live Events past September 2024.  For more information please refer to our blog post regarding this announcement:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/updates-for-town-hall-in-microsoft-teams-and-teams-live-events/ba-p/4148352\" target=\"_blank\">Updates for Town Hall in Microsoft Teams and Teams Live Events</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;---Original message below for reference---</p><p>With the introduction of Town halls in Microsoft Teams, Teams Live Events will be retired for commercial customers on September 30, 2024. This provides commercial customers with a 12-month window to prepare for the retirement and transition off Teams Live Events.&nbsp;</p><p><b>When this will happen:</b></p><p>September 30, 2024</p><p><b>How this will affect your organization:</b></p><p>After September 30, 2024, Teams Live Events will no longer be supported, and access will be discontinued. Customers will not be able to schedule, start, or join any events on Teams Live Events after this date. Existing recordings will be available to access until December 31, 2024. If customers want to retain any recordings from prior events, they will need to download the recordings and upload them to a different location before December 31, 2024. Between now and September 2024, customers can continue to use Teams Live Events with no change in their existing experience. However, our recommendation is that customers (both existing and new) transition to and start to use town halls as it becomes generally available on October 5, 2023.</p><p><b>What you need to do to prepare:</b></p><p>To prepare your organization for the transition we advise:\n</p><ul><li>Start to use town hall as it becomes generally available on October 5.</li><li>Learn more about town hall when documentation becomes available on adoption.microsoft.com and learn.microsoft.com on October 5.</li><li>Start planning to download recordings your organization wishes to retain before December 31, 2024.</li></ul><p><br></p>",
